WILL WRIGHT (VOICEOVER):
As you start

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,340
to refine your
prototypes, you'll

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,460
reach a stage where you
need to define an aesthetic.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,960
The visual aesthetic
is going to add

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,320
a whole new layer of meaning
and depth to your game.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,580
This is one of your primary ways
of communicating to the player.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,660
Finding your own style is
up to you as the designer.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,000
 

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,710
 

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,950
I would tend to approach, you
know, finding and discovering

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,530
an art style I think
very much in the same way

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,240
that I would approach, you
know, game concept research.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,380
Basically go out and look.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,610
You know, there are a
million references out there.

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,230
Not just games obviously.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,310
You know, back in historical
fine art, or in whatever.

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,000
You could just imagine
all these different areas

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,310
You could just imagine
all these different areas

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,080
to grab visual inspiration from.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,360
You know, we got a huge
amount of material inspiration

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,140
from those comic book
covers from the '40s.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,850
And that was a really
rich body of work

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,490
that had a very cohesive
style and feel to it.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,070
You know, sometimes
it'll be something

27
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,530
that you find like that,
that you kind of reference,

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,660
and say, we want it to
kind of feel like that.

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,280
Other times, it might
be something kind

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,450
of up and coming.

31
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,470
It's funny how even,
you know, nowadays

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,010
I see kids playing
these retro games.

33
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,470
Or they play
"Minecraft," you know,

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,000
which is incredibly,
you know, basic visuals.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,420
which is incredibly,
you know, basic visuals.

36
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,660
But, you know, like Lego, it
has become a style to them.

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,490
You go and look at these
Lego movies, which are great,

38
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,030
and it's amazing that they make
these amazingly entertaining,

39
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,250
very visually rich
movies, you know,

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,610
out of a Lego world,
rendered, and, of course,

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,530
animated, you know,
much more differently

42
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,860
than you can do with real LEGOs.

43
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,140
But yet, as a style
it's delightful.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,390
So I think that there are a
lot of things that may not

45
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,220
obviously, right off
the bat, feel like, oh,

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,140
that's a good visual style.

47
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,000
But if you think
about certain things

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,010
But if you think
about certain things

49
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,630
a little more deeply
to the next level,

50
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,140
you know, how could
that be a style?

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,560
You know, what
would it look like?

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,390
How would it animate?

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,300
You might discover regions
that are very unique.

54
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,250
I kind of like the
games that I work on

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,450
to have almost a toy
like feel to them.

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, like bringing up
a little bit more saturation

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,040
on the colors.

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
Maybe things being a
little bit more abstracted.

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,260
Feeling a little more, again,
you know, kind of model train

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,820
like.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,000
To me that kind of makes it feel
more playful and approachable.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
To me that kind of makes it feel
more playful and approachable.

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
One of the things that I
really enjoy looking at

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,020
is things like tilt
shift photography,

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
you know, where they're
actually taking pictures

66
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,470
of the real world, and now
making it look like a model

67
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,590
by changing the depth of
field, and the saturation,

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,940
and a few other things.

69
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,940
It's funny how you can
take one of those photos,

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,140
the original photo.

71
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,760
And it's of some downtown area.

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,380
Do a tilt shift version of it.

73
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,960
And now it looks
like something that I

74
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,340
want to touch, and grab, and
play with, and manipulate.

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,680
Instantly I have this
instinct to go in and start

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,020
imagining things that I
would want to do with it.

77
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,000
In some sense, it's an
invitation to agency.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,190
In some sense, it's an
invitation to agency.

79
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,760
You know, it's
saying, this is a toy.

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,810
This is a model.

81
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,510
It's here for you to
manipulate, play with.

82
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,190
Go at it.

83
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,920
You know.

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,660
So I think in a
subtle way, to me,

85
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,530
by making it feel a little more
toy like or model like, you're

86
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,070
kind of getting the player
into that mindset that this is

87
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,570
something for you to interact
with, not something for you

88
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,770
to just sit back and look at.

89
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:28,010
 

90
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,000
One of the things I did on
"Spore" that I really enjoyed--

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
One of the things I did on
"Spore" that I really enjoyed--

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,820
and this is in the
fairly early stages--

93
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,770
is I went back and I was
collecting, just downloading

94
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,370
hundreds of these images that
were appearing on the pulp

95
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,160
comic books back in
the '50s and '40s.

96
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,650
And these are like science
fiction stories or, you know,

97
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,350
whatever.

98
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,720
And it was always
like, you know,

99
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,340
some weird tentacled
alien holding

100
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,530
a blonde who's passed
out, and the spaceship

101
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,670
in the background.

102
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,010
The things in those
images, not just the way

103
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,720
they were rendered, but even
just the items, you know,

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,300
there was usually some kind of
alien, some kind of spacecraft,

105
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,000
some alien planet, some
muscle clad astronaut.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
some alien planet, some
muscle clad astronaut.

107
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,170
But I loved looking at just
the style of those comic book

108
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,050
covers.

109
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,550
Yeah.

110
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,930
In fact, we printed
them all out,

111
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,520
put them all over the office.

112
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,940
And it kind of became a guiding
principle for the entire game.

113
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,350
And it gave it a consistency.

114
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,000
And almost, you
know, I don't even

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
think it would be nostalgic
for any kid playing this.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,040
They probably didn't
even see those covers.

117
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,350
But yet, there was
almost a whimsy

118
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,550
to it that it brought into the
game at a very subtle level.

119
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,000
 

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,380
 

121
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,890
The visual style
within my games,

122
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,300
you know, initially it was
on these 8-bit computers.

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,590
And, you know, we were counting
how many pixels we had,

124
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,320
how many colors.

125
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,890
And it was really
severely limited.

126
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,560
Over time, you know, those
limitations eased up more

127
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,360
and more, until,
at some point, we

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,400
were getting a high
powered graphics card

129
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,850
with pixel shaders and whatnot.

130
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,280
In which case, you know,
we got to the point

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,000
where we could achieve pretty
high levels of realism,

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,650
where we could achieve pretty
high levels of realism,

133
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,360
which I didn't really
feel like I needed.

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,420
But on the other hand, we
were able to use these things

135
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,580
in ways that were
kind of unexpected.

136
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,350
Like, for instance, in
"Spore" one of our programmers

137
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,540
discovered that--

138
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,220
I think it was Kate Compton--

139
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,650
that she could use the pixel
shaders and the graphics card

140
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,070
to actually simulate
turbulence on a gas giant.

141
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,700
And she was getting like these
beautiful turbulence patterns.

142
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,740
And it's just very simple
manipulations of the UV

143
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,850
coordinates within
the graphics card.

144
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,000
So I think that those kind
of opportunities, you know,

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,350
So I think that those kind
of opportunities, you know,

146
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,140
things that we never
would have-- you know,

147
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,470
if we had to just do that from
scratch, calculate it all out,

148
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,570
we never would've done it.

149
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,410
But also, things more like
getting the player more

150
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,890
involved and more creative.

151
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,850
So the fact that we could do
procedural animation in "Spore"

152
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,690
was really a result of the
horsepower and the programming.

153
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,600
And it reflected itself in
the fact that, you know,

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,460
the graphics looked
in the style.

155
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,400
But the really important part
was the player created it.

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
And, you know, at the point,
it doesn't even really

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,530
And, you know, at the point,
it doesn't even really

158
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,860
matter so much what style it is.

159
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,280
If a player created it, it's
a whole different ballgame.

160
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,310
And so I think I've
been, on the art side,

161
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,410
you know, kind of more
in the direction of what

162
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,330
can we do to have the
player more responsible?

163
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,150
More creative?

164
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,210
More involved in these assets?

165
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,250
You know, in a way that--
where it's natural and fun.

166
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:26,300
 

167
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,030
Well, I've actually had
the luck and privilege

168
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,000
to work with really
great art directors.

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
to work with really
great art directors.

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,710
You know, and
generally, for me, it's

171
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,590
more been a matter of
their vision bringing

172
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,560
really good alternatives to me.

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,730
You know, so I usually have
two or three really good

174
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,450
alternatives to choose from.

175
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,960
And I don't feel like I can
really take the responsibility

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,210
for the quality of how that
ended up, because I really

177
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,040
think it was my art
director that, you know,

178
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,780
had a lot more to do
with it than I did.

179
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,920
But in general, you know, when
confronted with alternatives,

180
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,650
you know, I would tend to
say, OK, which one of these

181
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,180
feels more playful to me?

182
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,000
Which one of these
feels like something I

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,890
Which one of these
feels like something I

184
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,380
would want to go in, and pick
up, and grab, and manipulate?

185
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,030
That's the way I would just
kind of view it as a designer.

186
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,630
When we started working on
the very early ls of "Spore,"

187
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,920
the very first level is
microscopic, a little creature

188
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,100
swimming around in
a drop of water.

189
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,880
My art director I worked with
for many years, Ocean Quigley--

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,670
Ocean and I both, as
kids, had microscopes.

191
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,580
You know, I still
have a microscope.

192
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,950
And we started
thinking, OK, what

193
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,800
would this look like under
a microscope, under a slide?

194
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,250
And Ocean would actually
kind of prototype that.

195
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,630
And there was this thing when
you had the old microscopes

196
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,000
that, you know, as you move the
focus lever just a little bit,

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,670
that, you know, as you move the
focus lever just a little bit,

198
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,010
you know, things here were
now going out of focus.

199
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,680
And things deeper
were going into focus.

200
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,140
You're actually
manipulating the Z plane

201
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,490
where the focus was set.

202
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,910
And so you were actually able
to move in that third dimension,

203
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,730
you know, through a drop of
water, or whatever it was.

204
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,210
And we both thought about that.

205
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,630
And then Ocean went back and
found a way to render it such

206
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,460
that he could take
any of the planes,

207
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,060
and focus or defocus it
at, you know, his whim.

208
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,010
And we could have several
of these in a row.

209
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,620
So you could have,
you know, layers

210
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,000
of this that were out of
focus, but only one layer that

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,910
of this that were out of
focus, but only one layer that

212
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,180
was really in focus.

213
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,300
That actually kind of
brought up the idea that, OK,

214
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,740
maybe as you're playing
this cellular game

215
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,870
that you're actually
getting larger and larger.

216
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,300
In which case you'd be moving
from one plane to the next.

217
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,590
So as your thing
grew, we would now

218
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,200
defocus the layer
that you were on

219
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,970
and bring into
focus the layer that

220
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,980
was above you, which
were much bigger things

221
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,860
that you just saw as
fuzzy blobs before.

222
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,040
Then as soon as you grew to that
size, they became, you know,

223
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,070
in focus, and now part
of your game world.

224
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,900
So you were only
interacting with that layer

225
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,970
that was in focus.

226
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,000
So that was kind of a back
and forth thing that Ocean

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
So that was kind of a back
and forth thing that Ocean

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,740
and I did for a few
weeks, you know,

229
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,860
kind of coming up with and
then realizing that idea.

230
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,900
But it became kind of very
fundamental to the way

231
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,110
that part of the game worked.

232
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:47,250
 

233
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,870
Finding a good art
director is probably

234
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,590
going to be very similar to
finding a good sound director.

235
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,310
You want somebody who
listens, first of all,

236
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,000
and tries to understand,
you know, your vision.

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,450
and tries to understand,
you know, your vision.

238
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,520
Somebody who can come up
with ideas that you can't.

239
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,710
You know, maybe go
off in creative areas

240
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,180
that they are aware of because
of their specific expertise,

241
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,320
you know, whether it be
sound, or art, or whatever.

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
Bring them back to
you in a format,

243
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,160
you know, to where they
offer you some choice.

244
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,250
And I think that there's no,
you know, one size fits all.

245
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,830
Sometimes, you know, you'll want
a very, very particular style

246
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,000
as a designer.

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,180
as a designer.

248
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,160
And you don't
really want somebody

249
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,630
giving you five
other styles when

250
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,850
you know you want that style.

251
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,020
In which case you might,
you know, look for somebody

252
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,420
who specializes in that.

253
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,250
But at other times,
you know, you

254
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,960
might be a little more
open to, you know,

255
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,660
should it be more like
this or more like that?

256
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,780
Should it be more toy like?

257
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,340
More realistic?

258
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,600
Should it be darker?

259
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,060
Should it be more humorous?

260
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,580
I think that if you can speak
in that kind of a language,

261
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,170
you know, to anybody
on your team,

262
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,790
no matter what they're
doing, you know,

263
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,400
that I really think we want to
go for humor and whimsy here,

264
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,000
or I want it dark
and Gothic here,

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,430
or I want it dark
and Gothic here,

266
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,560
if they can now interpret
that and come back to you

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,450
with really good alternatives
that feel right to you,

268
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,530
I mean, that's how you
know you've got a good one.

269
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,110
You know, if you're telling them
you want to go in this style,

270
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,670
but they keep pushing
you to Disney,

271
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,880
then, you know, they've kind
of got their own agenda,

272
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
or they've got their own dogma.

273
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,820
It also depends on
the size of your team.

274
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,360
You know, if it's a very small
team your art director is also

275
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,050
going to be one of your
artists, maybe your only artist.

276
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,600
If you're on a big
team, the art director

277
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
is really going to be more
managing a team of artists.

278
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,000
And so your art director
will have the opportunity

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And so your art director
will have the opportunity

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,760
to find the right artist to
match that style for you.

281
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,630
Really you want somebody
that's going to mesh

282
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,940
with you, in particular.

283
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,670
I think that somebody who might
be a great art director for me

284
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,980
might be a really bad
choice for somebody else.

285
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,230
So, you know, first and
foremost, you have to have--

286
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,790
really kind of enjoy
collaborating with them.

287
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,650
You know, and I think
that's true of, you know,

288
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,490
most of your team.

289
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,050
That these are going
to be the people who

290
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,400
you're going to be working
alongside of for a long time.

291
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,110
You're going to be
putting a lot of time,

292
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,760
and passion, and
effort into this.

293
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,340
And if you don't
actually really enjoy

294
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,000
being around these people,
and enjoy working with them,

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,310
being around these people,
and enjoy working with them,

296
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,750
it's going to be work, you know.

297
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,550
But if you really
enjoy the process

298
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,010
of being with these people,
and collaborating, and creating

299
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,620
something with them, it's
going to be something
