00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:10,110
 

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,080
 Well, as you work on a
project, in early stages,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,080
you're going to want to
just get a sense of what

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,230
does this thing feel like
for me to interact with,

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,690
or the other people
on my team, how

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,480
do we feel about
interacting with this very

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,800
simple little system?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,130
Sometimes it might not even
be a prototype that we made,

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,650
or it might be a game
we pulled off the shelf.

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,250
What do we like about
that game or this game?

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,000
Those are the cheapest
prototypes, really,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,040
Those are the cheapest
prototypes, really,

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,800
if you can find some other game
that has some aspect of what

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,280
you want to include.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,190
Then, as you start
building something,

17
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,760
you start building not just the
system, but also the interface,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,290
the player controls.

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,090
Typically you'll want to bring
in a few people who play games,

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,630
but they've never
seen this, just

21
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,170
to figure out the interface.

22
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,270
Can they understand the
control scheme you've got?

23
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,650
Does that make sense to them?

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,150
Can they understand reading
the topography, the landscape?

25
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,440
Do they have some sense of
what they're supposed to do?

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,350
what occurs to them as you drop
them into this environment?

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,000
So it actually can become
a fairly granular process.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,260
So it actually can become
a fairly granular process.

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,420
It's not like we build
the game, build the game,

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,580
now we start playtesting.

31
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,330
It's really like we're
building prototypes

32
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,000
from the very beginning that
we are testing ourselves,

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,340
and then over time,
starting to test little game

34
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,130
parts with a few
people, here and there.

35
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,870
And eventually, we're bringing
in larger groups and maybe even

36
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,370
at some point
hundreds of thousands,

37
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,230
capturing metrics and building
these fairly complex diagrams

38
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,850
of them moving through
the game space.

39
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,000
 

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,480
 

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,850
This is the first
time you really

42
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,170
have a little bit of a peek
into the player's mind about how

43
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,810
they're going to interact with
this thing that you've built.

44
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,090
As a designer, you kind
of had this idea all along

45
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,470
that I'm going to
give them this.

46
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,660
They're going to be
able to do A, B, and C.

47
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,240
They're going to try
to get to D, whatever.

48
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,560
This is what you're imagining.

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,630
And as I am a
designer, I'm trying

50
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,980
to imagine, what would I enjoy?

51
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,580
How would I think about this?

52
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,740
But I put it in front
of somebody else,

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,000
and right off the bat,
you start learning things.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,100
and right off the bat,
you start learning things.

55
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,410
That maybe that wasn't
as easy as you thought.

56
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,880
Or they're not
even trying to get

57
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,970
to D. They're trying to get to
F, over there, for some reason.

58
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,979
And you go back and
revisit your assumptions

59
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,190
or maybe ask them why.

60
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,400
What did they see that caused
them to think that way.

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,330
Or maybe there
was just something

62
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,190
they thought of
that you didn't that

63
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,870
would be really cool to try.

64
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,560
And then again, you're learning.

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,550
So I think that this is
where for the first time,

66
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,390
the designers are taking this
concept out of their head

67
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,790
and trying to put it
into other people's heads

68
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,780
and seeing how it fits.

69
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,000
 

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,490
 

71
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,830
It's frequently very
hard to kind of imagine

72
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,740
the way other people are
going to see or understand

73
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,650
what you've made in a game.

74
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,140
And there's really
no replacement

75
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,000
for actually testing it.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,550
We did a lot of what we called
Kleenex testing, where we'd

77
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,670
bring people in who had
never seen the game before,

78
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,220
put them in front of it with
absolutely no instructions,

79
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,970
and just watch what
they started doing.

80
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,000
And see where they fail.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,970
And see where they fail.

82
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,760
See what's obvious.

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,670
A lot of times, it's
so obvious to you

84
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,410
that they should
press the red button,

85
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,450
but it will not even occur to
them to press the red button.

86
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,160
And you sit there and
watch 10 people not

87
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,830
press the red button, and
you start realizing, okay,

88
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,810
that's not the typical
person's understanding

89
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,350
of the way this thing works.

90
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,720
One thing that
was very important

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,250
is we put two people
in front one computer.

92
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,130
If you put one person
in front of a computer,

93
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,140
they'll sit there,
but they don't talk.

94
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,220
They get very quiet.

95
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,210
You don't know what
they're thinking.

96
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,870
If you take two people-- and
they have to know each other.

97
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,350
They might be friends
or spouses or whatever.

98
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,000
They'll be talking non-stop.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,940
They'll be talking non-stop.

100
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,810
Press the red button!

101
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,640
No, not the red one.

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,670
That makes that happen.

103
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,420
Oh, no it doesn't.

104
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,350
And they'll be explaining to
each other what they think.

105
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,870
And so those two
people, you can just

106
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,950
sit back and listen to
what they're saying,

107
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,750
and you understand
how they understand

108
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,190
the game in front of them.

109
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,670
After we use these people and
learn these things, we go back,

110
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,160
we make the red button
more prominent or whatever.

111
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,460
Then we never use them again.

112
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,290
We bring in a
whole different set

113
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,760
of people, who, again, have
never seen the game before.

114
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,060
So they're kind of unpolluted.

115
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,640
That's why we call
it Kleenex testing.

116
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,820
We use the tester once
and then throw them away.

117
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,000
But there's really no
replacement for that.

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,230
But there's really no
replacement for that.

119
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,370
And it's amazing as a designer
how frustrating, in some ways,

120
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,200
it is to sit back and
watch these people not

121
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,730
do the obvious thing you were
sure they were going to do.

122
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,690
Instead, they're all
doing this other thing.

123
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,440
And you have to adapt to that
and start realizing, okay.

124
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,650
Well, the model that they're
coming to this game with

125
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,870
is different than
what I was thinking.

126
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,700
So that's probably the
most important thing.

127
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:25,090
 

128
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,450
Playtests, usually
it's a large room.

129
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,000
The designers are sitting
back a few feet away.

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,110
The designers are sitting
back a few feet away.

131
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,900
And there'll be five or six
different workstations set up.

132
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,300
In front of each workstation,
we'll have two people.

133
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,260
Again, people that know
each other, friends,

134
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,690
spouses, whatever.

135
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,220
We put each group down.

136
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,190
We give them some
very, very rough sense.

137
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,470
Here's a game about
controlling little people,

138
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,050
or here's a game
about building cities.

139
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,220
And then we just turn it on.

140
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
And from that point
on, we don't say a word

141
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
unless they have some
technical problem.

142
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,840
They'll sit there as a pair
and try to basically figure out

143
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,630
how the game works.

144
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,420
What do we do here?

145
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,580
What does that do?

146
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe that will
make this happen.

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
Maybe that will
make this happen.

148
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,770
And the designers will
kind of rotate and just

149
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,870
be listening over the
shoulder of each group.

150
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,970
The designers also,
at that point,

151
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,470
are not interacting
with each other.

152
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,720
Typically, this will be a
design team of three or four

153
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,210
designers, and we're all
coming to our own conclusions

154
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,580
independently,
observing this group.

155
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,650
After it's all
over, the designers

156
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,390
will sit down and
collate their notes.

157
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,310
And then we will come
together as design group

158
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,110
and say, what did you see?

159
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,880
What were our biggest issues?

160
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
And usually it's pretty
clear that there'll

161
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
be one or two or three
things that we all agree on.

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
be one or two or three
things that we all agree on.

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,630
We all agree that
that was not obvious.

164
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,740
This was too hard.

165
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,910
They didn't enjoy this part.

166
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,280
And those are the
things we focus

167
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,340
on for the next iteration, which
might be a few weeks from then.

168
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,260
And these become
design risks for us.

169
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,620
We're always mitigating
and triaging design risks.

170
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,040
These are now the
top three design

171
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,470
risks we've discovered
from our playtesting.

172
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,910
We will make action items.

173
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,670
How can we basically
mitigate those risks

174
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,800
effectively very rapidly?

175
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,990
Do that, and the next
time we bring in a group,

176
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,550
we see if we were right.

177
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,000
And if we were
right, the next group

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
And if we were
right, the next group

179
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,690
is going to have
three different risks.

180
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,310
And we're repeating
that over and over,

181
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,260
always basically looking
at the top risks,

182
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,840
the top thing people
were not getting,

183
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,060
not enjoying, getting confused
about, whatever it might be,

184
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,440
and basically attacking it.

185
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,240
 

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,540
To test the engagement,
you have to have so much

187
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,490
of this, really, kind of
coming together as a whole.

188
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,000
And it's so far down the path
that the early testing has

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,590
And it's so far down the path
that the early testing has

190
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,460
really nothing to do with that.

191
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,830
The early testing
is do they know

192
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,870
how to operate this
windshield wiper

193
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,440
or that headlight control.

194
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,130
That's not going to tell
you how well the car drives.

195
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,630
As a designer,
though, this is where

196
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,340
I think your vision has
to carry you through.

197
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,920
Not just your vision,
but your ability

198
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,690
to communicate that vision
to the other stakeholders

199
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,550
in the project.

200
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,720
That I know that if we can
get the windshield wipers

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,760
working and the steering
wheel and the brakes all

202
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,740
that, that way over
here somewhere,

203
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,970
this is going to be a
really cool car to drive.

204
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,970
And that really is going
to be more, right now,

205
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,000
instinct and salesmanship
on your part as a designer.

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,180
instinct and salesmanship
on your part as a designer.

207
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,350
As you get later on
in the process now,

208
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,100
and you have your
working windshield wiper

209
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,470
control, and your
steering wheel,

210
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,190
and your brakes and
all that, now you

211
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,380
need to put those things
together and actually say,

212
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,600
okay.

213
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Now let's start getting some
sense that this actually

214
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,500
will be engaging.

215
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,870
And as soon as
possible, try to get

216
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,330
some set of these things working
together as a whole, such

217
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,790
that you can sit back and see
another person actually enjoy

218
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,650
it and start building
the model and start

219
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,500
trying to head for the goals and
get that flow state that you're

220
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,120
really trying to
achieve as a designer.

221
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
 

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,970
 

223
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,220
When you put a tester
in front of your game,

224
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,580
they are not going to sit
there and tell you exactly

225
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,050
what you're hoping to hear.

226
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,220
You know, they're
having an experience,

227
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,510
and you can, again, by putting
them with somebody else,

228
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,460
have them verbalize
their experience.

229
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,380
But as a designer, you have
to kind of decipher that.

230
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,040
You have to understand
when they say,

231
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,550
I think it's really
frustrating doing this,

232
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,970
but what they might
really mean is

233
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,900
they wish they had another
option to do that instead.

234
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,000
So a lot of times, what
they will express directly--

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,140
So a lot of times, what
they will express directly--

236
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,820
a lot of times,
they'll come back

237
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,030
and say, oh, I want
X, Y, and Z. They'll

238
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,750
start describing solutions to
you rather than the problem.

239
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,530
I would love this game if I
only had a jet pack and a laser

240
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,530
beam.

241
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,500
But in fact, what
they really mean

242
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,290
is that they don't like getting
stuck on the ground level

243
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,130
when they want to
climb that mountain.

244
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,280
So you have to distinguish
them offering you

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,200
solutions from what do the
solutions-- what problem does

246
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
that actually point back to?

247
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,000
And that's the problem you
need to solve as a designer.

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,010
And that's the problem you
need to solve as a designer.

249
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,720
Because probably
their solutions suck,

250
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,549
but the problem they're
referencing doesn't.

251
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,419
That problem is real.

252
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:44,340
 

253
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,670
Well, when you're
looking to playtest,

254
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,430
the signal to noise
issue really is

255
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,730
going to be a matter
in substantive data.

256
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,930
If you do enough testing
with enough people,

257
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,510
you'll start to be
able to distinguish

258
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,910
the signal from the noise just
because that's consistent.

259
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,580
The noise is all over
the place, random.

260
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,000
But when the same
five people are all

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
But when the same
five people are all

262
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,390
saying they didn't know
to press the red button,

263
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,680
but then they give you
totally different feedback

264
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,810
on everything else, you
know that the red button

265
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,310
is definitely a signal.

266
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,560
And I think that signal comes
in two dimensions, which

267
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,220
is why I was kind of saying that
you want to listen to what all

268
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,390
these groups have in common.

269
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,200
What problems and frustrations
are they all having in common.

270
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,590
But also, as designers, when
you go back and compare notes,

271
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,860
what problem do
all the designers

272
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,010
agree that it's pointing to.

273
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,430
Because this
designer might think,

274
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,000
oh, that problem is
their character creator.

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,810
oh, that problem is
their character creator.

276
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,470
No, this problem is
their navigation system.

277
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,970
But if all the
designers could agree

278
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,760
that those results point
to the same problem,

279
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,470
now that's a signal, for sure.

280
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,400
Too often, you're expecting your
players to be game designers.

281
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,820
When a player is
describing to you

282
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
that in their head, if
you had a garbage system,

283
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,570
it would be so much
cooler, they're

284
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,160
imagining it a
certain way that's

285
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,830
probably not the way
it works or the way

286
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,900
you're thinking about it.

287
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,520
But if you could
understand why they're

288
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,780
saying that, what limitation
or failure or flat spot

289
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,000
are they hitting that makes them
think that that addition would

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,410
are they hitting that makes them
think that that addition would

291
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,280
make it better,
then that's good.

292
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,820
And a lot of times,
sometimes they're

293
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,980
telling you to add
stuff, and in fact, it's

294
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,630
about removing stuff.

295
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,250
A lot of times, you
got too much stuff.

296
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,320
Too much noise from the
player's point of view.

297
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,120
One of my favorite quotes
is about Japanese gardening.

298
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,750
It's that your garden is not
complete until there is nothing

299
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,790
else that you can remove.

300
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:28,290
 

301
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,940
Engagement is one
of those things

302
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,000
that has a very wide range.

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,280
that has a very wide range.

304
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,440
When we initially
have prototypes,

305
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,960
and we bring players
in to try it out,

306
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
it's more a matter of
getting them to stay there

307
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
in front of the computer.

308
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,180
Keep playing, keep
playing, keep playing it.

309
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,490
Towards the end, if you're
really starting to nail it,

310
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,740
it's a matter of you trying
to pull them away from it.

311
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,530
Okay, time to stop.

312
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,150
Time to stop.

313
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,520
I think, right
off the bat, there

314
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,610
are a couple of very
simple little tricks.

315
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,570
A lot of times, if I'm
showing somebody a game,

316
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,000
and I'm actually playing it
and explaining how it works,

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,520
and I'm actually playing it
and explaining how it works,

318
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
if they all of a sudden
want to grab their mouse

319
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,370
and say, let me try, let me try,
or if I see a game somebody is

320
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,710
showing me, and all of a
sudden, I feel the urge to hey,

321
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,140
let me see if I can do it,
that's a great measure,

322
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,890
right there.

323
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,290
Right off the bat, just by
watching somebody play it,

324
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,240
I've understood enough
to think that I want

325
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,310
to go in and try something.

326
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,700
I have some of the model.

327
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,240
In fact, this starts even before
you see somebody playing it.

328
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,760
It starts maybe when you see
the box or see an ad for it.

329
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,260
At that point, you're starting
to say, hey, that sounds fun.

330
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,300
That sounds kind of cool.

331
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,380
I want to try it.

332
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,000
So that's a certain level
of engagement, right there.

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,660
So that's a certain level
of engagement, right there.

334
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,050
And then later down the road, if
you have something really good,

335
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,760
you'll start having
people write you back

336
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,020
that I was up all night
playing this thing,

337
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,770
and I couldn't stop.

338
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,190
And I didn't realize it was
5:00 in the morning, whatever.

339
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,610
That means you really
kind of nailed it.

340
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,670
But I think along
the way, again,

341
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,090
there are going to be certain
players that maybe just love

342
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,780
what you've made,
a few that hate it.

343
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,430
Or maybe it's the other way
around, most people hate it,

344
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,630
but a few love it.

345
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,120
And you need to be willing
to kind of experiment

346
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,600
by changing a few
rules, a few parameters,

347
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,680
and making the game a
little more dynamic in terms

348
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
of the player choosing to
try and balance that out.

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,690
of the player choosing to
try and balance that out.

350
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,800
And there's really no substitute
for capturing metrics.

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
If you can capture metrics
on a large number of players,

352
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,590
you can really balance
this out nicely

353
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,030
over a wide range of people.

354
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,970
It used to be much
more anecdotal.

355
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,770
We would sit and
watch 10 people do it

356
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,590
and try to go with
our gut instinct.

357
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,580
And engagement and
difficulty, some of it

358
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,690
could be player moderated.

359
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,610
The player chooses to
go down this path, which

360
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,380
is more difficult,
or they choose

361
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,600
to just sit back
here and enjoy this.

362
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,000
If they're enjoying it,
again, that's engagement.

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,340
If they're enjoying it,
again, that's engagement.

364
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
It didn't have to be
challenging to be engaging.

365
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,120
Some people like to do
creative, weird experiments,

366
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
and they find that
very engaging.

367
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,090
Other players are going to
want a continual challenge all

368
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,810
the time as fast as possible.

369
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,120
Letting that be player moderated
is probably the best choice.

370
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,540
There are things
where we actually

371
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,410
see the players trying
to make an achievement

372
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,370
and getting frustrated.

373
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,470
They're failing too often.

374
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,510
And that's where I think the
metrics come in a little more

375
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,350
heavily.

376
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,460
You can actually kind of
measure how many people

377
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,830
are failing it on
the first time,

378
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,230
the second time, the third time.

379
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,000
And I think that's
something where

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,870
And I think that's
something where

381
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,320
it's a little more
metric driven,

382
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,990
but also it's
player categorized.

383
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,570
Certain players are going to go
down that path, other ones are

384
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,190
going to be different.

385
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,850
So the metrics will
be very different

386
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,110
for those types of players.

387
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,950
And that's where as a designer,
you have to sit back and say,

388
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,790
okay.

389
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,580
Here we're dealing with
the trophy seekers,

390
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,380
here we're dealing
with the socializers.

391
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,940
Whatever it is,
however you choose

392
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,800
to categorize your
different players,

393
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,510
you need to understand
that they're going

394
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,590
to have different metrics.

395
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:29,870
 

396
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,000
Sid Meier had a great quote.

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,560
Sid Meier had a great quote.

398
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,900
It's that some games you
design for the players,

399
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,970
and some games you
design for yourself.

400
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,180
And I experienced that, I think,
with a game I did way back,

401
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,770
called "Sim Earth."

402
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,230
I got fascinated with
building this elaborate model

403
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,580
of the planet Earth, and
the climate, and the oceans,

404
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,520
and the lifeforms, and
everything, the geology.

405
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,960
And it was a pretty cool
little model for its time,

406
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,410
running on a PC.

407
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,030
And it had all these
little controls

408
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,140
where you could adjust
things about the planet.

409
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,000
But it was very
complex as a model.

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,260
But it was very
complex as a model.

411
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,510
And I really enjoyed
playing with that model.

412
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,760
But later I realized,
as we were putting

413
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,490
this in front of
players, it was kind of

414
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,650
like putting them in the cockpit
of a 747 that's in a tailspin,

415
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,990
heading to the ground, and
all the gauges are spinning.

416
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,970
No matter what they do,
it's going to crash.

417
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,640
And they try everything they can
think of, and it still crashes.

418
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,030
You know.

419
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,030
That's kind of what it
felt like to the players.

420
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,500
I got so caught up in the
idea of building this little

421
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,250
know planetary model on
a computer for myself.

422
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,000
And I think that kind of
reinforces the idea of testing.

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,630
And I think that kind of
reinforces the idea of testing.

424
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,530
But also, as a
game designer, you

425
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,820
have to be able to kind of
go back to the drawing board

426
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,490
when you see people interpret
what you've done in a totally

427
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,360
different direction.

428
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,420
"The Sims" is a better
example of that, where I was

429
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,710
so fixated on the architecture.

430
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,880
And then we started putting
in front of a few people

431
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,430
and saw how
fascinated they were.

432
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,760
And it makes sense that they
were fascinated, basically,

433
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
messing with these little Sims.

434
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,340
The house was a
backdrop for it, and it

435
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,240
was one of the
kind of challenges

436
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
and became an integral
part of the gameplay.

437
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,000
But the real focus of the game
that the average player came

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,120
But the real focus of the game
that the average player came

439
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,060
to it with was on
messing with the people.

440
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,600
And so as a game designer, I
had to kind of sit back and say,

441
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,280
okay, look.

442
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,800
I think that really
is the way I need

443
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,150
to go with this, which I did.

444
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,630
So I think you need to be able
to revisit your assumptions

445
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,270
at the very beginning when
you see the way people are

446
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,530
interpreting what you've done.

447
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:24,280
 

448
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,820
I think in terms
of the people we

449
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,610
would tap to bring
in, initially, it's

450
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,360
going to be a pretty
wide range of people,

451
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,000
but still we have some
sense of this is a game

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,460
but still we have some
sense of this is a game

453
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,620
that older people
enjoy, younger.

454
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,170
Once we get a sense of,
like, where it's really

455
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,910
hitting the mark, we
can get a little bit

456
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,890
more specific about the kind
of people we want to bring in.

457
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,840
We want to bring in
more women or more

458
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,940
younger players,
whatever that is.

459
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,500
And get more details in terms
of also maybe these are people

460
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,540
that are really creative.

461
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,100
They're not so much
achievers, but they

462
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,620
want to do creative stuff in
there, more storytelling, more

463
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,200
customization, more
personalization.

464
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,140
This other group might
be more into advancement

465
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,720
and showing off in
the social groupings.

466
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,000
Whatever it is.

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,130
Whatever it is.

468
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,410
But that's something
that you kind of, again,

469
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,940
discover over time.

470
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,840
And then as a designer,
you can say, okay.

471
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,640
We're going to go
down that path,

472
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,560
or we're really going to
focus on these people,

473
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,790
or maybe we want
to keep it broad.

474
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,110
We actually want
to kind of bring

475
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,550
in those other people
that weren't as interested

476
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,170
and try to keep these
at the same time.

477
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,970
That's when you're
making a design decision

478
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,790
as to which demographic group
you're going to be going after.

479
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,350
But even then, the demographics
are frequently very misleading.

480
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,710
But the Sims, again, we
initially sold this to gamers.

481
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,670
And gamers thought, oh,
it's a weird new thing.

482
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll try it out.

483
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,000
They played it for a few weeks.

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,450
They played it for a few weeks.

485
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,620
And what happened is these
were mostly teenage boys,

486
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,040
and what happened
is their sisters

487
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,290
were watching them play.

488
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,490
Their sisters, for
the very first time,

489
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,810
said, hey, I want to try it.

490
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,730
They bring it to their
hand-me-down computer.

491
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,590
And that turned out
to be our big hit,

492
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,710
initially, for "The Sims,"
was 12-year-old girls.

493
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,120
So you can't always predict.

494
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,160
And even if you can
predict, you might not

495
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,530
hit that target demographic
right off the bat.

496
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,600
There might be actually
kind of a viral component

497
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,290
to how it spreads to them.

498
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,960
Because these 12-year-old
girls were not

499
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,880
going into computer stores
and buying computer games.

500
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
They just happened to see it
on their brother's computer.

501
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,250
They just happened to see it
on their brother's computer.

502
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,079
 

503
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,450
In my experience,
focus group testing

504
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,950
has been pretty
close to useless.

505
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,740
You know, so many times--

506
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,390
we had a focus group
many, many years ago.

507
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,089
And we had like
four game designs

508
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,069
that we were basically
just describing

509
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,170
to this audience of gamers.

510
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,829
And one of those
four was "The Sims."

511
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,740
We described each of
these game concepts, what

512
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,000
it would be like to play,
would they be interested, would

513
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
it would be like to play,
would they be interested, would

514
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,110
they want to play it.

515
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,470
The other three, they all liked.

516
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,090
That was great.

517
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,740
"The Sims" was the one
idea they all hated.

518
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,910
No, I would never play that.

519
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,530
Never touch it.

520
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,070
I don't even remember
the other three

521
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,020
games, what they ended
up being, but I know

522
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,730
they weren't a big hit at all.

523
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,890
So in that sense, you're kind
of expecting your players

524
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,460
to be designers.

525
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,580
Because when we were
describing "The Sims" to them,

526
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,570
I know they could not
unpack it in their head

527
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,030
and be playing in
their imagination

528
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,360
the game that I was envisioning.

529
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,820
And there was no easy way for
us to communicate it to them.

530
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,000
So it doesn't surprise
me they hated it,

531
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,580
So it doesn't surprise
me they hated it,

532
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,040
because the game
that they designed

533
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,540
based on the description
was horrible.

534
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,210
And I think that's one of the
real limits of focus group

535
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,880
testing.

536
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,550
Play testing, on the
other hand, as soon

537
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,380
as we brought a few people
in, the same type of people,

538
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,590
same demographic, we put
them in front of the system,

539
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,290
where they can manipulate people
and live their little lives,

540
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:16,870
they loved it.

541
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,980
They really had fun
getting in and doing it.

542
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,650
So in that case,
they weren't doing

543
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,370
the heavy lifting of imagining
how this would actually work.

544
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,830
You know, we had
already done that.

545
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,540
Now they were actually
in the experience.

546
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,000
 

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
 

548
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,570
People have
different definitions

549
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,530
of what a beta test is.

550
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,110
You know, in my mind,
I tend to think,

551
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,590
you know, a beta
test is basically

552
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,350
roughly your complete game,
with all the components, all

553
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,590
the functionality, in it, that
you're handing over to people,

554
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,750
usually a fairly
large group of people,

555
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,290
and you're basically
confirming that it

556
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,450
has the right kind of
motivational hooks,

557
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,650
the right player
agency involvement

558
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,250
that you thought it would.

559
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,000
Also a much more mundane aspect
is you're discovering bugs.

560
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,670
Also a much more mundane aspect
is you're discovering bugs.

561
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,540
Where is it crashing?

562
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,250
What are people doing
with it to cause it

563
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,660
to do things you didn't intend.

564
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,090
And it might be a hard
crash, or might be they

565
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,800
just kind of got stuck
in this game space

566
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,130
that you didn't ever expect
that they would get into.

567
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,880
And a lot of times,
you'll discover things

568
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,700
in beta testing that are
serendipitous upside.

569
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,160
You know, that, wow, I never
thought players would do that,

570
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,550
and it actually works,
and it's kind of cool.

571
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,870
So there might be
things that you

572
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,870
decide to lean into as a
result of beta testing,

573
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,330
but that's not the
primary purpose.

574
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,080
I think the primary
purpose is making sure

575
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
that in general, this thing is
behaving the way you thought

576
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,000
it would, at scale.

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,430
it would, at scale.

578
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,320
And that the players
might be fanning out

579
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
in different
directions in there.

580
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,410
At this point, you finally
have an opportunity

581
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,990
to get a sense of
how many players are

582
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,890
going this way versus that way.

583
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,880
Maybe in playtesting, it might
have been five versus four,

584
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,260
and in beta testing, it turns
out to be 5,000 versus 1,000.

585
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,500
Maybe the ratios are way
off from what you thought.

586
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,920
But for the first
time, you really

587
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,570
get at-scale testing,
both for bugs, exploits,
