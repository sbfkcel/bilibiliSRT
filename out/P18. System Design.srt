2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,470
 

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,810
WILL WRIGHT: Within these
games, within these worlds,

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,950
there are a lot of moving
parts, a lot of dynamics.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,310
You want this to be a rich,
interesting environment

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,830
for the player to explore.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,910
My approach has always
been to step back and think

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,300
of this whole thing as a system.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,010
What is the system
that's happening here?

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,510
And actually, when you get down
to the engineering of things

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,260
like simulations,
you really do need

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,510
to think of it as a system.

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,350
And you need to think about
it, what is my paradigm?

14
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,000
What is the way in which I'm
going to structure the world?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,670
What is the way in which I'm
going to structure the world?

16
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,409
How is it going to operate?

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,040
What are the parts?

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,580
How do they interact
with each other?

19
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:45,850
 

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,810
Systems are interesting.

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,190
In some sense,
what they're going

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,930
to lead us to is this idea
that everybody in a game

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,430
is going to be exploring the
possibility space of that game.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,990
Where are all the
possible states

25
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,820
that that world could be in?

26
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,000
For something like chess,
it's fairly obvious,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,430
For something like chess,
it's fairly obvious,

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,320
although it's a very
big, branching tree.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,239
It's a branching tree.

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
Every move in chess leads to
another set of possible moves.

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,390
And you unfold that branching
tree of all the possible moves

32
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,090
of chess and you come up
with an astronomical number,

33
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,230
but it's still finite.

34
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,500
There are a finite number
of possible states in chess.

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,390
The very early games had
very simple branching trees,

36
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,620
very much like chess.

37
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,080
Basically, structure branching
trees that were explicitly

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,370
put there by the designer.

39
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,160
And this is very much
like one of those old

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,000
choose your own adventure books.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,610
choose your own adventure books.

42
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,190
If you're going to go into
the cave, go to page 7.

43
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,830
If you're going to go to the
top of the hill, go to page 20.

44
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,270
But basically, the
writer's having

45
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,290
to fill out every possible
branch of that book.

46
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,040
So it's a very limited
structure, a very limited world

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,270
to explore.

48
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,140
Later games started doing what
I call gated experiences, a game

49
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,170
like, let's say, Quake or Doom.

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,490
You're within a level and
you have all this agency

51
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,320
and freedom within that
level, but until you

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,690
get through the level and get
to that locked door at the end,

53
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,270
basically, you're
in this little room,

54
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,000
this little, small regional
possibility of space.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,450
this little, small regional
possibility of space.

56
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,980
Once you get through
that, it opens

57
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,630
another regional
possibility of space.

58
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,380
So you basically have
these little islands

59
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,500
of possibility of space
with gates between them.

60
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,700
And then there have been basic
hybrids of these two models

61
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,780
over time.

62
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,830
But then as players
and designers

63
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,250
started building more
open-ended simulations,

64
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,990
it opened up a lot more.

65
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,630
So as we started building
open-ended games--

66
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,070
sandbox games, Grand
Theft Auto, Sims--

67
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,070
we're actually looking
at a possibility of space

68
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,110
that's vast, large.

69
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,000
And this is when we
really have to now view it

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,030
And this is when we
really have to now view it

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,710
as a system, not as a
branching tree of possibility.

72
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,670
We're not going to map
out every possibility.

73
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,390
What we're going to
do is we're going

74
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,840
to build a set of things
that interact in a way

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,780
to, basically, generate
these possibilities for us.

76
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,460
For the Sims, the
way I visualized

77
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,030
it was that, basically,
you had two directions you

78
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,350
could go for achievement.

79
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,350
You go for social achievement
or material achievement.

80
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,690
You could try to make a
lot of friends in the Sims,

81
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,970
build a big family,
have people like you.

82
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,100
Or you could try to
make a lot of money,

83
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,000
buy things for your
house, grow, acquire.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,670
buy things for your
house, grow, acquire.

85
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,850
And really, the way I visualized
it was almost like a bowling

86
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,090
alley here, in that if I went
down one path or the other,

87
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,010
it was like getting
stuck in a gutter.

88
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,960
To achieve maximum
success, you had

89
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,950
to balance the two
achievements together

90
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,620
to get the highest
level of achievement,

91
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,610
which is right down the middle.

92
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,760
If you went too far to
one side or the other,

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,270
you'd actually get stuck on
a local maxim on either side.

94
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,930
So this is basically the
way I was visualizing

95
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,670
a certain region of
the possibility space

96
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,500
within the Sims the
players would encounter.

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,000
We use that as a guideline
for tuning the game.

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,700
We use that as a guideline
for tuning the game.

99
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,640
After we actually were really
in deep tuning of the game--

100
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,310
we had thousands of
players playing it--

101
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,600
we, in fact, were actually
mapping the real possibility

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,020
of space they were
going through,

103
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,560
and we were actually looking at
how the players would fan out

104
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,630
across these dimensions.

105
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,340
These are graphs here
of the way players

106
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,480
were actually fanning out.

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,360
At first, we saw too
many on this side,

108
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
not enough on that side.

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
We changed the parameters
of the game a little bit

110
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,530
and actually evened
out so that these

111
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,150
were equally attractive
to a wide group

112
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,730
players, that whole space.

113
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,000
 

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,290
 

115
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,900
Going a little bit deeper, and
actually, how do we build this?

116
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,940
How do we think about it?

117
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,490
How do we engineer it?

118
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,090
I needed to find
two things here,

119
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,260
the way I think about them.

120
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,630
What is structure?

121
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,420
What is something made of?

122
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,740
What are its parts?

123
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,420
A structure of a
tree, it has a trunk.

124
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,100
It has branches.

125
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,769
It has leaves.

126
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,470
Then there are dynamics,
and this is process.

127
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,000
This is what happens over time.

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,880
In this case, it's what
can happen to a tree?

129
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,320
How does it grow?

130
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,000
Can you cut it down?

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,610
Can you cut it down?

132
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,110
Can you turn it into firewood?

133
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,790
What happens over the seasons?

134
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,350
So those are all
the dynamics that

135
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,850
can happen to a
tree, which are very

136
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,610
different than the
structure of a tree.

137
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,270
From that, I started
imagining the different things

138
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,640
I use as a designer to
build these systems.

139
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,450
And structurally, I
basically think in terms

140
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,590
of three types of structure.

141
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,140
One is what I call agents.

142
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,230
These are objects that can move
around, interact in a world

143
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,190
somehow.

144
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,190
Next is networks.

145
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,000
These are things that are
connected through some type

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,400
These are things that are
connected through some type

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,860
of relationship formally.

148
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,430
And it could be relationships.

149
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,800
It could be economic.

150
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,760
It could be biological.

151
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,630
It could be anything.

152
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,200
And the last one is layers.

153
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,880
And this tends to
be more spatial.

154
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,250
Something like
Sim City, there's,

155
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,500
basically, the pollution layer.

156
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,650
There's the traffic layer.

157
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,520
These are things
that are specialized.

158
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,370
And everything in the
game, like Sim City,

159
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,580
is one of these three things.

160
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,090
It's either an agent,
a network, or layer.

161
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,330
The road, basically, is a
network of intersections

162
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,680
connecting areas.

163
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,000
Something like pollution,
crime are layers.

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,010
Something like pollution,
crime are layers.

165
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,860
Cars moving around, people
around, even buildings

166
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,590
are agents, sitting on the
landscape with some identity

167
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,390
and some parameters.

168
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,330
So that's the typologies,
or the structure, of games,

169
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:55,150
the way I think of systems

170
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,540
Next, when we get into dynamics,
any of these topologies,

171
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,000
any one of these dynamics can
occur, things like propagation.

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
any one of these dynamics can
occur, things like propagation.

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,930
How does something
spread through that?

174
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,620
Growth, grouping, order,
allocation, mapping,

175
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,750
specialization, all
these are dynamics that

176
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,940
occur within these typologies.

177
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
In some sense, these
are now the verbs.

178
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,800
The topologies are
the nouns that we're

179
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,030
building the game out of.

180
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,370
These dynamics are the verbs.

181
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,150
And lastly, how do
we think about this?

182
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,300
What is our underlying metaphor
for bringing these things

183
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,820
together?

184
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,000
And that's what
I call paradigms.

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,220
And that's what
I call paradigms.

186
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,050
Initially, there
were things way back

187
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,090
in the '40s called cybernetics.

188
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,050
But really, it was very simple
systems, like a thermostat.

189
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,470
And originally,
this was developed

190
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,560
for things like autopilot, a
very simple machine control.

191
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,570
Governors on steam
engines, even,

192
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,880
are an example of a
cybernetic system.

193
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,610
But in essence, it's a
very simple, little system

194
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,670
trying to seek a behavior,
seek some set point.

195
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,670
It might be temperature.

196
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,820
It might be the speed
of an engine, whatever.

197
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,650
It was only in the '50s,
when the very first

198
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,100
primitive computers
started coming around,

199
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,000
that the idea of system
dynamics came out.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,630
that the idea of system
dynamics came out.

201
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,810
A guy named Jay Forrester kind
of came up with this concept.

202
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,990
And it's almost hydrological.

203
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,710
It's almost based upon
a chemical refinery

204
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,500
in that in system dynamics,
you just basically have valves

205
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,740
and flows and containers.

206
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,650
A container might be population
or it might be number of cars.

207
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,020
A flow might be birth
rate or death rate.

208
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,460
And you have little algorithms
that will adjust the flows.

209
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,920
For the birth rate,
death rate, you

210
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,810
can see what the
population does over time.

211
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,000
And he would build these
very elaborate models

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,090
And he would build these
very elaborate models

213
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,720
of very complicated systems,
things like the world--

214
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,560
food production.

215
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,020
Or in fact, he was
the first person

216
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,730
to actually build a city model
using this kind of paradigm.

217
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,230
The next one I'm
going to talk about

218
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,850
is cellular automata, which
really kind of came to its own

219
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,560
when PCs were really
starting to come out

220
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,640
and people had access
to cheaper computers.

221
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,370
Although, in fact,
cellular automata were

222
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,300
predated system dynamics.

223
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,450
Cellular automata are
basically the idea

224
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,320
that there's a grid and cells.

225
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,000
And these cells can
either be on or off

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,130
And these cells can
either be on or off

227
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,560
or have quantities in them.

228
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,530
But basically, all the
dynamics within that

229
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,410
are based upon the neighbors and
the behavior of the neighbors.

230
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,140
The simplest example of
this is a game called Life.

231
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,690
John Conway, a mathematician,
came up with this very simple

232
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,820
system, and it's a grid.

233
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,790
Actually, I'm going to
go to the whiteboard,

234
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,070
just to explain this because
it's actually quite simple.

235
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,860
 

236
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,740
So in Conway's Life, you
basically have a little world.

237
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,870
It's a grid.

238
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,000
Within this grid, every cell can
either have one of two states.

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,880
Within this grid, every cell can
either have one of two states.

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,720
It's either alive, it is full,
or it's dead and it's off.

241
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,190
Now, the rules
for Life basically

242
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,280
say that if one cell, right
here, has exactly three

243
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,020
neighbors-- and we're counting
all the neighbors like that.

244
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,790
If there are exactly three
cells alive around it,

245
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,430
like so, this empty
cell now comes to life.

246
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,860
On the next turn, the
new cell appears here.

247
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, if a given cell
is already alive

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Now, if a given cell
is already alive

249
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,740
and it has three or two
neighbors, it stays there.

250
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,870
If it has less than two or
more than three, it dies.

251
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,230
So this one only has one
neighbor, so it dies.

252
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,680
So basically, that's the whole
rule set for Conway's Life.

253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
Now, it sounds very simple.

254
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,790
You're just counting whether
it has two or three neighbors

255
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,830
and whether it comes
to life or dies.

256
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,330
Turns out that when
you turn this on

257
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,990
and you put a few
cells in there,

258
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,000
there's an explosion
of complexity.

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,780
there's an explosion
of complexity.

260
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,870
All this stuff starts
happening, really unpredictable,

261
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,860
surprising stuff.

262
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,960
And people have studied
this thing for years.

263
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,270
I spent months studying.

264
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,010
In fact, I taught
myself programming

265
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,510
trying to program
Life and make it

266
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,720
faster and faster and faster.

267
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,070
 

268
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,210
As an example, if you
put this shape into Life

269
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,070
at the very beginning
and just start it,

270
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,330
it will explode into this whole
set of hundreds of things,

271
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,000
and start moving around
and have behavior.

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,830
and start moving around
and have behavior.

273
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,660
And it's always exactly
the same every time.

274
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,460
It's deterministic.

275
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,330
But it's all a result of
the two simple little rules.

276
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,960
And this is one of the
best examples of emergence

277
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,300
that Conway, who programmed
this, discovered it.

278
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,970
There was no way he
could have predicted

279
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,110
the elaborate
behaviors that were

280
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,490
going to happen in this little
world based upon those two

281
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,380
rules.

282
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,280
It just emerges as
a result of that.

283
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,950
And it's emergent complexity.

284
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,440
So you have this amazingly
complex, little world

285
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
that's emerging out of this
incredibly simple, little rule

286
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,000
set.

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,490
set.

288
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,910
Somebody asked me just recently
what my favorite game was,

289
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,010
and it's Go.

290
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,900
And the reason to Go
is my favorite game

291
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,630
is because Go has very
much the same property.

292
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,580
Go has two very simple
rules, one of which

293
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,990
almost never happens.

294
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,200
But yet the strategy of
Go is incredibly complex,

295
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,280
relative to the rules set.

296
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,040
And for me, that's a wonderful
aesthetic for game design.

297
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
When it's the simplest set of
rules that you can create that

298
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,530
leads to the widest
range of complexity

299
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,530
and the most interesting
world that you can explore,

300
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,690
with strategy and behavior.

301
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,000
Cellular automata actually
became a key part of Sim City

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,920
Cellular automata actually
became a key part of Sim City

303
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,360
in the way it operates.

304
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,110
Basically, a lot of
complexity of Sim City

305
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,680
comes from this connected
to a system dynamics

306
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,330
model, like Jay Forrester had.

307
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,490
Again, Jay Forrester's model
was, basically, containers

308
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,070
with whatever.

309
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,210
Let's say population.

310
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,960
And then little valves
that would control.

311
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,660
This might be birth rate.

312
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,760
This might be death rate.

313
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,640
Later on, we might
have another one

314
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,000
that we add for migration,
whatever we want to.

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,700
that we add for migration,
whatever we want to.

316
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,020
Now, Jay Forrester came up with
this model, central dynamics,

317
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,520
and people started trying to
model a lot of different things

318
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,690
with it.

319
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,870
Back in the late
'60s, early '70s,

320
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,000
there was a group that
started building what they

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,390
called the World Dynamic model.

322
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,600
And they actually started
modeling the world economy,

323
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,300
food production, population
growth, all this stuff,

324
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,330
to get some sense of where
the world was headed.

325
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,580
In fact, they started a group
called the Club of Rome,

326
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,000
and there was a very
famous book published

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,330
and there was a very
famous book published

328
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,040
called "The Limits to Growth."

329
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,000
And in that book,
they were basically

330
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,870
showing the results of
their world simulation

331
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,300
that they were
running around 1970.

332
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,430
And it was showing that
the world economy would

333
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,130
collapse around 1985 to 1990.

334
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,170
And food production,
people would starve.

335
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,310
And it didn't happen.

336
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,310
What turned out is they
looked back at the model

337
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,730
and they found that they were
off on a few little factors.

338
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,020
They didn't foresee the Green
Revolution, for instance,

339
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,930
that the efficiency of food
production per land area

340
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,000
was going to go up a little
bit more than they thought.

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,580
was going to go up a little
bit more than they thought.

342
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,670
And what was surprising
was that that little

343
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,100
bit that they were off led to
an incredibly different result

344
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,670
than what really happened.

345
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,260
And that was really
our first inkling

346
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,080
into what became known
as chaos theory, the idea

347
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,670
that sometimes the initial
starting position of something

348
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,290
can lead to a totally
different outcome

349
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,480
if it's just a
little bit displaced.

350
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,640
A good way to think
about chaos theory,

351
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,890
we have basically, what
we call, chaotic systems

352
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,360
and stable systems.

353
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
If I take a bowl, for
instance, like that,

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,390
If I take a bowl, for
instance, like that,

355
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,410
and I drop a marble into
it, it might land here

356
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,590
or I might drop it there.

357
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,590
Either way, it's going
to go around a little bit

358
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,710
and it's going to pretty
much end up at the bottom.

359
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,280
OK, that's a stable system.

360
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,040
A chaotic system, if we take
that bowl and we invert it,

361
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,760
like so, and we drop a ball
and displace it a little bit,

362
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,500
now if it lands here, it
might roll way off over here.

363
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,440
If it lands right there, it
might roll way off over there.

364
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,420
So this is really
a chaotic system,

365
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,350
where a very small change
in the initial position

366
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,000
can lead to a wildly
different outcome.

367
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,850
can lead to a wildly
different outcome.

368
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,840
And that's what they discovered
in the World Dynamic model.

369
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,210
And all of a
sudden, chaos theory

370
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,400
started putting real
limits on things

371
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,050
that we could predict
with simulations.

372
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,810
Turns out that
things like weather,

373
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,300
and even other things
like [INAUDIBLE],,

374
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,060
tend to be chaotic so
that even if we have

375
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,430
a very detailed simulation
and we put a lot of horsepower

376
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,170
behind it, there's
still going to be

377
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,720
a very deep level
of unpredictability

378
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,460
to these kind of a system.

379
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,500
Another direction that
these paradigms have taken

380
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,000
is called network theory.

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,690
is called network theory.

382
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,910
And a network is just anything
containing nodes and links,

383
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,890
like that.

384
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,760
Turns out you can visualize
so many things as a network.

385
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,470
You can visualize biological
systems and metabolic systems,

386
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,140
things within your body, the way
the chemicals and proteins flow

387
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,190
through your body.

388
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,250
Economics, social
systems, all these things

389
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,260
can be visualized as a network.

390
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,750
And of course,
including the internet.

391
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,000
Now, it turns out that
these networks have

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,090
Now, it turns out that
these networks have

393
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,650
some surprising properties.

394
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,140
Things are just not obvious.

395
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,330
One of those things
is that if you

396
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,370
have a disconnected
network, like this,

397
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,390
and you start randomly
connecting these things,

398
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,470
just randomly, it turns
out that all you need

399
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,590
is the average of about one
connection per node to have

400
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,260
a fully connected
network, basically,

401
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,950
for any sized network.

402
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,090
So over time, if I just do
one connection per node,

403
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,590
I almost always
end up with almost

404
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,000
a fully connected network.

405
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
a fully connected network.

406
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,180
Another surprising result is
that for any sized network,

407
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,050
above a very simple
one like this,

408
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,050
the distance, what they
call the graph width,

409
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,750
between any two
points in this network

410
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,450
is almost never
more than six steps.

411
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,240
So from point there to
point there, 1, 2, 3, 4.

412
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,330
And this is, of course, the six
degrees of Kevin Bacon thing,

413
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,120
that even across
the earth, they've

414
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
shown that I can find
any other person on earth

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,420
shown that I can find
any other person on earth

416
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,840
through six steps of people.

417
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,710
I know this person.

418
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,640
That person knows that person.

419
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,930
That person knows that person.

420
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,500
I can connect myself to almost
any other person on the planet.

421
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,370
So these are very non-intuitive
things, but actually,

422
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,530
as a designer, this is
part of your language

423
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,560
that you can use within your
game to build these systems.

424
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,950
You can represent any kind
of system in your game.

425
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,600
Using multiple
paradigms, you can

426
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
choose which paradigm is
best suited for my game

427
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,020
when I'm building a system.

428
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,000
And this occurs both at
the conceptual level,

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,090
And this occurs both at
the conceptual level,

430
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,860
but also at the
engineering level as well.

431
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,420
 

432
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,150
So these become a
lot of things that I

433
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,580
think of as a
designer of systems

434
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,140
that I use to build games.

435
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,290
On top of this, there are
also certain properties

436
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,810
that I find interesting to
think, in terms of dimensions

437
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,870
within the system.

438
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,440
One is local to global,
how much of local effects

439
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,760
versus global effects
and where do they meet.

440
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,000
In Sim City,
something like traffic

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,180
In Sim City,
something like traffic

442
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,810
is very local to that
one spot on the road.

443
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,080
The overall tax rate
of the city is global.

444
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,910
And there's some things
that are in between.

445
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,160
What's the police
effectiveness within the city?

446
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,990
Order to disorder.

447
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,910
Things that are
very, very ordered

448
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,350
become very predictable,
and sometimes you

449
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,270
want that in the game.

450
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,600
Other things are totally
disordered, random, chaotic.

451
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,320
And even things like
cooperation to competition

452
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,410
is a dimension within a game.

453
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,000
You can have some games
that are very competitive,

454
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,490
You can have some games
that are very competitive,

455
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,110
others that are
very cooperative.

456
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,460
But there are also a lot of
spots in between those two.

457
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,020
And sometimes the game can
actually shift where one moment

458
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,060
you're playing cooperatively,
another time you're

459
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,170
playing competitively.

460
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,230
One of my favorite
old games is Mule.

461
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,069
And Mule had that
beautifully done,

462
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,849
where you're competing
with other players.

463
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,970
But in some sense, if you
don't cooperate with them

464
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,050
to some degree, the entire
colony collapses and so

465
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,730
you all lose.

466
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,650
And so I love the fact
that that game actually

467
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,940
had cooperation and competition
in the same game structure.

468
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,000
 

469
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,920
 

470
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,340
I tend to be a
very visual person.

471
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,850
In school, I didn't think math
was that interesting at all

472
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,010
until, at some point,
I started realizing

473
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,200
that I could basically
turn almost all of math

474
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,730
into geometry.

475
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,710
And I could take almost
any branch of math

476
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,680
and as soon as I could
imagine it as geometry,

477
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,440
I love it and it makes sense and
it's totally intuitive to me.

478
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,730
So that's just the way
I think about things,

479
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,000
is I tend to try to bring
it into the visual realm,

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,550
is I tend to try to bring
it into the visual realm,

481
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,520
in essence.

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,230
There's a certain
part of my mind

483
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,070
that I think does very
good spatial reasoning.

484
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,320
Other people tend to
do better, I think,

485
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,690
with audio reasoning,
or something else.

486
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,230
But as a game designer,
I'm imagining, even

487
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,360
as a game player when
I come into a game,

488
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,190
I'm trying to imagine,
what are the things I

489
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,360
could do in this game?

490
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,040
How far can I go?

491
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,320
How hard is that?

492
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,740
In some sense, I'm
building a map.

493
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,000
Not an explicit overt
map of the terrain,

494
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Not an explicit overt
map of the terrain,

495
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,110
but a map of my abilities,
my agency, my freedom.

496
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,200
I always tend to visualize
that as some type of topology.

497
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,860
If it's a gated experience
maybe with rooms,

498
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,750
I see these as nodes
with connectors,

499
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,460
and that's just a way
for me to visualize

500
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,770
the topology of that structure.

501
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,310
It might be more free
floating agents moving around,

502
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,100
or it might be something very
rigid, like a cube or layers.

503
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,960
But even the
behavior, what we call

504
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
phase space in mathematics,
can be viewed as a topology.

505
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,160
phase space in mathematics,
can be viewed as a topology.

506
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,130
A lot of the really cool
work in chaos theory

507
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,190
has come by visualizing
these systems,

508
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,150
collapsing a fairly complex
system down into something

509
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,410
that you can now
look at as a picture.

510
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,750
You take something as simple
as a pendulum swinging

511
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,560
back and forth.

512
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,710
And in the chaotic
system, basically, it's

513
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,340
going from know zero movement,
fast movement at the bottom,

514
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,480
back to zero movement.

515
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,740
One dimension is, let's
say, the kinetic energy,

516
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,490
and the other one is
the potential energy.

517
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,000
So the potential energy
is how high it is.

518
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,690
So the potential energy
is how high it is.

519
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,700
Kinetic energy is
how fast it's going.

520
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,940
If you imagine these
drawings of curved spacetime,

521
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,690
you put a planet on spacetime
and it bends it down here.

522
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,430
OK, so you're actually
bending space there.

523
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,110
Turns out time bends
exactly the same way.

524
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,430
So if something is going past
that planet through that bent

525
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,440
spacetime, the
timeline for that is

526
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,930
a lot longer than if the
planet weren't there.

527
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,720
And that's a really clear way
of visualizing time dilation,

528
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,930
relativity.

529
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,320
So I love the fact that
you can just take things

530
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,000
like that-- as soon as
you make the visual,

531
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,660
like that-- as soon as
you make the visual,

532
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,990
it's so instinctual and
intuitive, which is actually

533
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,700
a good lesson, I think,
for your players.

534
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,470
If you can take things
in your game that

535
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,980
seem overly complex at first
and make them more visual,

536
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,580
so the player can interpret
it with their intuition

537
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,150
rather than having to do
some more abstract reasoning,

538
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,280
you can make something
that's very complex actually

539
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
seem much more approachable.

540
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,590
 

541
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,000
Just to recap,
basically, we have

542
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,140
Just to recap,
basically, we have

543
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,050
these things that we can
build our systems out of--

544
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,760
agents, networks, layers.

545
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,050
Layers tend to be more rigid.

546
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,660
Agents can be more flexible.

547
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,870
Topologies, that we can have
a structure from these things.

548
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,770
And these networks,
also, are not

549
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,260
just within the
systems of our games.

550
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,540
The overall context of
what we're dealing with--

551
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,080
the players, the world, the
way we distribute and market

552
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,750
games--

553
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,040
can also be viewed as networks.

554
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,000
We have the technology
networks of our computers

555
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,040
We have the technology
networks of our computers

556
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
to be connected to the internet.

557
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,970
We have platform networks
of different types

558
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,180
of platforms, so their games by
play on this, or that, or iPad,

559
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,410
or PC.

560
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,260
We have formats networks.

561
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,220
What kind of games
are we playing?

562
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,430
Brain networks that we're
dealing with in the player.

563
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,850
And the social
networks that we're

564
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,540
dealing with in the
communities of the players.

565
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,530
So all these things, really,
these topologies and systems,

566
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,990
aren't just things
that we're going

567
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,500
to use to construct our
simulations in our games,

568
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,050
but these are also
things that we

569
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,000
can use to represent
and understand

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,300
can use to represent
and understand
