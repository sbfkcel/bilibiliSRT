WILL WRIGHT: More

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,830
I've found the psychology to be
the really tricky, challenging

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,700
part of game design.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,860
The technology is
advancing every year.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,960
What we can do on
modern computers

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,170
makes me as a designer
feel almost unlimited.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,220
You can do amazing things
on these electronics.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,360
Player psychology though,
human brains are not advancing.

They're the same as they have
been a hundred years ago.

We have to learn how it works.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,710
We have to learn how it works.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,689
What are the inner
workings of that computer

15
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,010
and how can we exploit it
and use it to our advantage?

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,550
There's actually a great book,
I think it's out of print now,

17
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,180
it's called "Maps of the Mind".

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,330
Each page was kind of
a visual representation

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,790
of one psychological theory.

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,320
It might be Maslow's
Pyramid or Freud and the Id.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,210
Each one of them was
a different way, a bit

22
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,120
different perspective, on the
human mind and human psychology

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,220
and the way it worked.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,000
Each one is kind of a tool
and has its particular purpose

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,610
Each one is kind of a tool
and has its particular purpose

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,670
and works well in certain
situations and not well

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,800
in others.

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,290
None of them are really
the right approach

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,500
that I'm going to
religiously adhere to.

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,170
But each one contains
something valuable

31
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,150
that might be of use
to me in the future.

32
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,940
Maslow's Pyramid turned out
to be very useful for The Sims

33
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,470
for instance.

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,200
The vary base core
of The Sims had

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,290
to do with feeding the
motives of The Sims--

41
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,250
hunger, entertainment,
sleep, all those things.

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,650
We started building very,
very simple little prototypes

43
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,450
that was just a set of
sliders and buttons.

44
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,320
I could press a button for
food, sleep, entertainment,

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,130
and basically trying to
balance these little sliders.

46
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,890
At some point, we decided one
of the major goals in The Sims

47
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,220
would be to have them actually
go to work and earn money

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,800
so you can go out and buy
more junk for your house.

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, we basically had a reason
to get all these sliders up

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,680
Now, we basically had a reason
to get all these sliders up

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,140
to some state that they go
to work in a good state.

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,340
The better their state is,
the more money they earn.

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,700
So we're connecting
these base motives

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,630
to the larger aspirations,
which is exactly what Maslow's

55
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,740
Pyramid was all about.

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:23,410
 

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,200
The game designer is
really kind of playing

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,610
with the player's psychology.

59
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,400

61

certain goals
states, you're trying

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,740
to get them into a
certain motivation

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,200
within this little world
that you've crafted

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,580
and make them want
to do things or want

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,560
to avoid things happening.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,270
You basically want to set up
this structure in their head

67
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,470
that they're motivated to
do this and avoid that.

68
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,240
But you want to have
an environment where

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,600
they start feeling strong
motivations for their actions.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,980
And then, now it's up
to them to start testing

71
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,000
their model against your model.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,660
their model against your model.

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,360
They start building that
mental model against your game.

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I think it was PT Barnum
that said something like,

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,200
no entrepreneur ever went broke
overestimating the intelligence

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,430
of the American public.

77
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,600
Kind of my version of that
is, no game designer ever

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,250
went wrong by overestimating
the narcissism of their players.

79
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,170
And so the more it
is about the player,

80
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,590
the more the player
is celebrated,

81
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,510
the more the player is the
center of that universe,

82
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,890
generally, the
more they like it.

83
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,000
 

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,240
 

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,530
At the very beginning, one
of the chief fundamental

86
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,540
components of game
design, one of the skills

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,480
that you really want to
master as a game designer,

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,890
is the ability to build a mental
model in your player's head.

89
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,580
And this is really
kind of an art form.

90
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,950
This is something I've
learned from magic actually,

91
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,380
from magicians, is that when
a magician is performing

92
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,000
a trick, what they're
actually doing

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
a trick, what they're
actually doing

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,430
is they're getting the
viewers, the audience,

95
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,520
to craft a mental model
of what's going on,

96
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,900
but they're getting
them to craft

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,240
exactly the wrong mental model.

98
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Such that, you think
this is in my hand,

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,410
you think this is my hand, I
pull the handkerchief back,

100
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,080
it's not.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,370
I've actually, thought a
lot of different techniques

102
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,580
as a magician, got you to build
an incorrect mental model,

103
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,050
and then when I
do the reveal, you

104
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,910
see that hey, my
mental model was wrong.

105
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,410
In fact, what the
magician was doing

106
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,680
was some other
manipulation over here.

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
And as a game designer,
we take that kind

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,030
And as a game designer,
we take that kind

109
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,560
of approach in some ways.

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,140
We're actually having
our players interact

111
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,560
with little pieces of computer
memory and code and interface

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,050
buttons, but in
their head they're

113
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,610
building an entirely
different model.

114
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,270
There's a world that they're
in with verbs and nouns

115
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,780
and affordances and agency
and actions and possibilities

116
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,920
and goal states.

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,650
That's what we're actually
building in our player's head.

118
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,080
And so in some sense,
the game designer

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,890
is a much more elaborate
magician doing this.

120
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,000
 

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,720
 

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,660
We're modeling
things all the time.

123
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,670
You're modeling other
people all the time.

124
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,610
I'm imagining what my
friend is thinking about me.

125
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,010
I'm imagining what
they know about me

126
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,550
and I try to be
consistent with that.

127
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,820
So I'm not only building
a model of my friend,

128
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,680
but I am building a model
of their model of me.

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,610
It's recursive.

130
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,820
I can remember
what they have seen

131
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,470
me do, how they've
see me behave,

132
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,000
and I have a very rough sense
of what their model of me

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,420
and I have a very rough sense
of what their model of me

134
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,140
is and I try to be
consistent with that.

135
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,640
So this modeling is pretty deep
and recursive in that sense.

136
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,470
You can put any kid in
front of a video game

137
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,270
and right off the bat they
start mashing buttons, looking

138
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,490
at what's happening,
they observe, and it's

139
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,250
very much the scientific
process where they are doing

140
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,850
hypothesis, experiment,
look at the result,

141
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,880
go back refine the hypothesis,
experiment, look at the result.

142
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,610
It's that iterative
scientific process.

143
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,910
And that is basically model
building of a different sort.

144
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,430
Now, in building
models we take in a lot

145
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,000
of data, a lot of examples.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,020
of data, a lot of examples.

147
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,400
And from that, we
started looking

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,060
for patterns in that data and
things that are different,

149
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,860
things that are the same,
and after that we start

150
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,320
building abstractions
out of that--

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,090
these what we call schema.

152
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,530
And basically,
these are patterns

153
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,710
that we see in the world.

154
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,170
Any kid can tell
you the difference

155
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,150
between a dog and a
cat, and that's a schema

156
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,360
that we have internally.

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,910
And it's really a very
fine set of features

158
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,130
to distinguish the difference
between a dog and a cat.

159
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,840
But it's a schema that
we have, and so we

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,730
can look at any new
dog or cat and say

161
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,000
right off the bat it's a dog
or a cat against our schema.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,130
right off the bat it's a dog
or a cat against our schema.

163
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,910
Now, from that we started
building more elaborate things

164
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,820
called models.

165
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,190
These schema,
these patterns, now

166
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,130
become the components of the
models that we're building.

167
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,320
And that now influences
our behavior.

168
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,930
We behave against these models,
basically running scenarios.

169
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,020
Should I do this or that?

170
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,440
Should I get this
job or that job?

171
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Should I say A or B?

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,050
And so all of our
behavior really

173
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,230
is based against us playing
these models in our head

174
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,970
about what we should do.

175
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,550
Now schema are really
interesting in that we

176
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,450
have schema for some
different things.

177
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,000
For instance, in
a restaurant, we

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,390
For instance, in
a restaurant, we

179
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,220
have this rough idea
of things that happen

180
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,040
when we go into a restaurant.

181
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,200
Not all these things always
happen, but in general, that's

182
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,910
a pretty good schema
for what to expect

183
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,620
when I walk into a restaurant.

184
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,660
Some of the schema that
we are dealing with.

185
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,810
Classification, who are the
good guys and the bad guys?

186
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,230
Causality, if you find a
pot of gold, you'll be rich.

187
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,660
Empathy, if you see a hungry
dog, you feel bad for it.

188
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,670
Agency, if you have control,
you can command your fate.

189
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,280
We have schema for all of
these different things.

190
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,000
And you're controlling
the player's schema

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
And you're controlling
the player's schema

192
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,590
in some sense as a designer by
what you present them with, how

193
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,090
it operates, how it behaves.

194
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,090
When I see five turtles come at
me in a row and all attack me,

195
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,460
I start saying, OK, turtles
are a bad thing in this game.

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,360
That's a schema I'm building
as I play the game, part

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,190
of a model building.

198
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,310
And games, in some sense,
are generating these worlds

199
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,690
from the models.

200
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,910
So a game is really almost
the reverse of science.

201
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,160
Science is really taking all
this data from the world,

202
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,880
compressing it down into a
very concise, small rule set--

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,990
laws of physics.

204
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,000
Games take a very
concise codebase

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,240
Games take a very
concise codebase

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,600
and try to expand it into a
wide range of possibilities

207
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,950
that the player's going
to encounter in your game.

208
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,800
And then the player is trying
to reverse engineer that process

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,860
and now build a concise
representation of that.

210
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,610
So it's really kind
of interesting the way

211
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,140
these models are
coming and going

212
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,530
against the data and the
operation of the world.

213
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,160
But again, these
mental models are key,

214
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,140
I think, for a game
designer to realize

215
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,350
that's what they're building.

216
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,880
 

217
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,000
The mental model that we're
trying to create in the player

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,370
The mental model that we're
trying to create in the player

219
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,410
is something that may or may not
have a purpose really for you.

220
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,400
I might be building
a mental model

221
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,730
for some player of SimCity
about how cities work.

222
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,410
But I know, as a
designer of SimCity,

223
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,280
that that model is not
going to be correct.

224
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,740
There are things
about SimCity that

225
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,410
do not match the real world.

226
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,030
A lot of times,
games and filmmakers

227
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,100
as well will actually
build a model

228
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,890
that they know is
incorrect, because that's

229
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,280
what the players expect.

230
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,310
SimCity 2000 I know that if
the nuclear power plant caught

231
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,000
on fire there'd be a giant
nuclear explosion, which

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,750
on fire there'd be a giant
nuclear explosion, which

233
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,380
doesn't happen.

234
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,240
It doesn't happen that way.

235
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,010
There's fallout, but
no nuclear explosion.

236
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,440
But all the players
expected that.

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,760
And when it didn't happen they
were saying, why didn't it

238
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,790
blow up?

239
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,160
So we made it behave that way.

240
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,350
In movies, you see people
shooting guns all the time

241
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,180
and never hitting each
other, or cars always

242
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,620
blow up in the crash.

243
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,320
All these things that you're
building the wrong model

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,420
in the player's head
compared to reality,

245
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,060
but as an enjoyable experience,
they kind of expected--

246
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,620
why didn't the car blow up?

247
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,530
So I'd say that what
is correct is really

248
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,000
the open question here.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,730
the open question here.

250
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,930
Are you trying to build--

251
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,300
if I'm trying to
build a training

252
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,470
simulator for an
airline pilot, then

253
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,570
yes, I want that simulator
to actually train

254
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,300
them to build a model of the
way that plane really behaves,

255
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,010
and that's my target.

256
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,950
As an entertainment designer,
and if I'm designing

257
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,700
a city simulator and--

258
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,160
most of these
players are not going

259
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,420
to be designing
a city like this.

260
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,630
In fact, real cities are
not designed with one person

261
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,030
as the overlord like that.

262
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,790
It's much more political.

263
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,360
So I'm not that concerned that
we take liberties like that.

264
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,000
 

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,800
 

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,050
As an interactive experience,
we want this whole thing

267
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,970
to be centered on the player.

268
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,790
And understanding that
every player is different

269
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,990
is kind of key to that.

270
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,280
We want every player to be
able to take their own path,

271
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,530
have some freedom,
agency, within our games.

272
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,910
So we need to start thinking
about how the players see

273
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,040
themselves, their identity.

274
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,380
Now, everybody wraps a lot of
things around who they are.

275
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,000
When you present
yourself to other people,

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,130
When you present
yourself to other people,

277
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,320
depending on the context,
there's a place we live,

278
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
your neighbors.

279
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm from Ohio, whatever it is.

280
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,220
Your job, your profession,
your skill set.

281
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,760
Hobbies, things that you do.

282
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,390
Or brands, products that you
maybe have some allegiance to.

283
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,330
All these things are
components of your identity.

284
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,600
And when you're interacting
with other people,

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,790
these are ways in which
you mark yourself.

286
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,160
You kind of surround
yourself with these things

287
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,220
saying this is part of
what defines who I am.

288
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,000
Now, we actually have a lot
of very personal aspects

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,970
Now, we actually have a lot
of very personal aspects

290
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,850
to our identity,
but also, we have

291
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,290
communities that we live in.

292
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,030
Sometimes real
geographic communities,

293
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,030
other times online communities.

294
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,660
Some of these are
based upon locations,

295
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,570
some are based upon
interest, profession.

296
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,880
And then there's
the world around us

297
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,930
that we all kind of share what's
going on in the wider world.

298
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,010
It's almost like this
target with successive rings

299
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,780
going outward.

300
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,580
The innermost ring
being the most personal,

301
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,140
the thing that most
defines me as most unique.

302
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,220
Going to the very general.

303
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,320
We all live in the same world.

304
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,000
Now, we find that as
players get into games,

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Now, we find that as
players get into games,

306
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,270
they kind of all come
in in the same way.

307
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,730
They're all kind
of casual players.

308
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,730
I'm going to check this
out, see what it's like.

309
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,100
Some people really get into it.

310
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
Other people might play it for
a little while, put it aside,

311
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,050
this game isn't for me.

312
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,880
But the players that
kind of keep going down

313
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,560
that path into your
game have a trajectory,

314
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,840
and depending on what
kind of game it is,

315
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,200
they can take different paths
into that what a lot of times

316
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,830
becomes a community.

317
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,290
For The Sims, we
actually had a lot

318
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,000
of casual players
started to turn

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,270
of casual players
started to turn

320
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,560
into what we called collectors.

321
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,930
They would go on
the web and they

322
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,400
found a lot of other people
had made objects or characters

323
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,110
that they could download
into their game,

324
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,240
and so they would start
collecting specific things.

325
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,110
Some people would actually
kind of specialize

326
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,060
their collections.

327
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,080
I want to do Wild West
stuff or Star Wars things

328
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,550
or whatever it is.

329
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,410
Other people were
actually the ones

330
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,440
starting to build these
collections on their web sites.

331
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,900
And at first they would make
a few objects, make a website,

332
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,890
but then other
people would start

333
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,150
contributing to their website.

334
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,000
Some of these websites
grew very large

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,070
Some of these websites
grew very large

336
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,890
and even became subscription.

337
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,530
People were paying money
just to download content

338
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,430
that other players had created.

339
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,160
And the core creators that were
doing the really cool stuff

340
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,030
were the ones kind of
feeding these websites.

341
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,420
So there was kind of an
ecology that was happening here

342
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,130
over time as the player
got more and more involved,

343
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,460
and then it became more and
more part of their identity.

344
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,390
The ones that were
actually creating

345
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,310
this stuff for The Sims,
this was their hobby.

346
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,160
They spent many hours
doing this stuff.

347
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,270
And it was kind of how
they saw themselves

348
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,520
as a creator of
stuff for this game.

349
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,000
In a lot of ways, it's kind
of like an ecological pyramid,

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,520
In a lot of ways, it's kind
of like an ecological pyramid,

351
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,040
and the numbers kind of
decrease as you go up,

352
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,830
but there's also a base to
that pyramid that's supporting

353
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,640
the upper people, the creators.

354
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,810
The very skilled people
who are making cool things

355
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,440
are supported by this very
wide base of casual players.

356
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,360
There's flow within this
ecology of recognition.

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Casual players are saying,
oh, that person's stuff

358
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,630
is the best, or this
is the coolest website.

359
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,900
And that's what was fueling the
people building these things.

360
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,630
They just liked having
that recognition.

361
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,000
That whole thing has
given rise to very large

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,290
That whole thing has
given rise to very large

363
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,600
online communities around games.

364
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,160
And these communities--
a lot of times

365
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,830
the people involved
in these communities

366
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,000
don't even play
the game anymore.

367
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,710
That's actually kind
of interesting to me

368
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,150
is that the people that were
doing The Sims for instance,

369
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,680
some of them were running
big websites, creating

370
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,260
all this stuff, and
they hadn't played

371
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,140
the game in months or years.

372
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,460
But still, these were
people they knew,

373
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,920
they had relationships, they
had a place in this community,

374
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,430
they had recognition,
they had a reputation.

375
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,000
And for a lot of people, these
games become kind of a hook

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
And for a lot of people, these
games become kind of a hook

377
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,970
into a social network of
sorts or different types

378
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,020
of social networks.

379
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,490
And there are other games that
are more competitive where

380
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,900
they're actually playing
professional sports

381
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,320
like in these games and there
are whole leagues and things

382
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,820
like that.

383
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,200
So these games, for
a lot of people,

384
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,840
became a doorway into
these communities,

385
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,420
which now becomes a
very integral part

386
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,040
of their identity, which is
kind of a different thing

387
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,460
than having the game just be
focused on what the player is

388
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,700
doing in the game.

389
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,450
But now the game is
kind of part of how

390
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,000
they think about themselves
and how they present themselves

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,910
they think about themselves
and how they present themselves

392
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,450
to the world.

393
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:38,370
 

394
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,890
I've heard a lot of
stories from players

395
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,710
about how they've taken
their game experiences

396
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,650
and how it's changed their life.

397
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,920
For some people, they
became storytellers.

398
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,110
They started making a few
stories, either Machinima

399
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,290
or whatever, uploaded
it, and a lot of people

400
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,660
liked it and loved their style
and the stories they told.

401
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,880
And so it really pushed
them into creative writing

402
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,000
or filmmaking.

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
or filmmaking.

404
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,880
I've talked to a lot of
people who actually played

405
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,590
SimCity went into
civil engineering

406
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,110
just because they
enjoyed dealing

407
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,670
with that kind of system.

408
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,670
Other people that have
gone into biology because

409
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,300
of SimAnt, things like that.

410
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,340
So sometimes it's motivational.

411
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,090
And in fact, in education I
think the fundamental issue

412
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,630
we have in education isn't
so much how we teach kids,

413
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,370
but it's how we motivate kids.

414
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,950
If you can get a kid
motivated in a subject,

415
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,560
they have plenty of resources
to go learn it on their own.

416
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,000
In fact, I have
three boys at home,

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,080
In fact, I have
three boys at home,

418
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,580
and they're learning
more on YouTube

419
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,670
right now than they
are in school by far.

420
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,420
And they're following
their own interests.

421
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,560
Once they get motivated--

422
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,540
my 8-year-old wants to
learn about Minecraft,

423
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,190
and he finds these
Minecraft videos,

424
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,520
and he can learn at his own pace
exactly what wants to learn.

425
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,250
So once you can get them
motivated about something,

426
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,160
just get out of
their way basically.
