WILL WRIGHT: Games
and story I think

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,610
have a very interesting
relationship with each other,

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,980
and I see a lot
of game designers

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,910
that really are aspiring
to be storytellers.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,620
And I've always thought that
the coolest stories are always

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,740
coming from the players.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,280
I mean, it's nice
to have a backstory

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,000
or here's the world and all
that, but really you want

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,870
or here's the world and all
that, but really you want

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,390
every player to basically
encounter their own story,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,610
create their own story by
what they do in the game.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,990
That's the really
interesting story for me.

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,980
But as creatures,
as organisms, we

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,850
are faced with this kind of
fundamental dilemma, which

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,660
is that we're here,
the world's out there.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,420
Basically, we have a limited
bubble of experience,

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,190
things that we know
about the world,

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,320
will experience directly
about the world.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
Basically, we take this
in through our senses.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,000
We see the world, we
perceive it in certain ways.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,090
We see the world, we
perceive it in certain ways.

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,620
It goes into our imagination.

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,870
We actually start building
little models of it.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,940
And based upon how we
interpret the world around us,

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,170
it influences our behavior,
how we act out there.

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,090
Now, that limited
bubble of experience

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,070
is not really enough for us
to build very effective models

30
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,610
of the world.

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,440
And it's that experience
that we're building

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,910
these models of the world from.

33
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,340
So over time, actually
through evolution,

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,780
I think we've discovered
two other methods.

35
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,750
One is to have toy
experiences, where

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,000
we have symbolic experiences
and kind of abstract

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
we have symbolic experiences
and kind of abstract

38
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,100
that back into the real world.

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,170
The other one is to learn from
other people's experiences.

40
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,620
If my friend the cave
man comes back and says,

41
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,810
a tiger almost ate me
when I left the cave,

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,310
I didn't have that
experience, but I

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,400
know the next time I
leave that cave, I'm

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
going to look out for a tiger.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,140
I was able to learn
from his experience

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,990
without having that
experience directly myself.

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,100
Now, over time,
through our culture,

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,490
we've come to call one of
these things play, these toy

49
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,670
experiences, and
the other one story.

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,740
These are both, though,
fundamentally educational

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,000
technologies.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,490
I think this is why we enjoy
consuming these things,

53
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,200
because they actually
help us build

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,870
more elaborate, more
detailed, world models

55
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,729
with a limited experience base.

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,650
Now, story and play I
think have a really kind

57
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,790
of interesting two sides
of coin relationship here.

58
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,500
Some of the really
cool stories, the ones

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,630
that really capture
your imagination,

60
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,070
you can deconstruct into
characters, worlds, locations,

61
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,140
objects.

62
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,450
I watch my eight-year-old
playing with Star Wars LEGOs,

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,000
and he creates his own stories
with the storm troopers and all

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,060
and he creates his own stories
with the storm troopers and all

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,480
the components from Star Wars--
and he kind of understands

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,520
that universe-- but now becomes
kind of a set of things for him

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,390
to play with.

68
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,220
I think some of the
best games where players

69
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,040
have a lot of
freedom, creativity,

70
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,700
lead to really cool stories.

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,410
The games are actually
generating stories

72
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,640
as the players play.

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,910
So in some sense, I think really
good stories can generate play

74
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,660
and really good play
can generate stories.

75
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,360
So I think the two are
kind of self supporting,

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,110
but they're very, very
different actually.

77
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:00,000
 

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,160
 

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,660
A lot of times you
hear that stories

80
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,810
have such a deep, emotional
connection whereas games

81
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,640
are flat.

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,010
I don't really
think that's true.

83
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,090
I think that games really
haven't matured as much.

84
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,970
But I think what it is
is that they have very

85
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,440
different emotional palates.

86
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,240
The emotional palette of film
is totally based upon empathy.

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,030
You can look at characters,
actually simulations

88
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,550
on the screen, which we
call actors pretending

89
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,970
to be these characters,
and they are basically

90
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,790
pretending to have emotions
and we're empathizing

91
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,670
with those emotions.

92
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,000
And so when they feel
sad, we feel that sadness.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
And so when they feel
sad, we feel that sadness.

94
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,610
When they're happy,
we feel happy.

95
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,640
Games, the emotional palette
is based upon agency.

96
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
The fact that I did it.

97
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,980
That I'm responsible,
I have accountability,

98
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,620
I'm the one that pushed the
joystick in that direction.

99
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,440
So I think that the
kind of emotions

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,760
that we can actually get out
of games are very different.

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,350
Things like guilt, pride,
accomplishment, teamwork

102
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,000
are things I've
felt in gaming I've

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,010
are things I've
felt in gaming I've

104
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,890
never felt in linear media,
because they were things that I

105
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,470
was actively involved with.

106
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,800
I remember when I played Black
and White the first time.

107
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,670
You have this creature
you're basically raising

108
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,750
and you can discipline
it or reward it

109
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,870
and I just started slapping
it to see what happened

110
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,310
and it got really downtrodden
and sad and all that

111
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,570
and I actually felt so
bad, even though I knew

112
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,560
it was a digital character.

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,040
But I felt so bad, and I felt
guilty for having done that.

114
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,590
There was a much earlier
game called Choplifter where

115
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,630
you flew this little
helicopter around,

116
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,000
you were rescuing these
little tiny people,

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,430
you were rescuing these
little tiny people,

118
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,690
which were really
like 10 pixels high,

119
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,270
and I'd pick them
up in the helicopter

120
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,190
and bringing them out.

121
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,360
They'd get out after
I rescued them.

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,430
They'd jump out of the
helicopter and wave at me,

123
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,030
and I felt so proud.

124
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,860
And it was 10 wide
pixels I'd rescued.

125
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,180
But it was just funny that
it was able to kind of tweak

126
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,980
that circuit in my head.

127
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,170
A feeling of
accomplishment and pride.

128
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,790
And again, this is
something I've never

129
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,500
really felt watching a movie.

130
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,740
I've felt indirectly that
some character in the movie

131
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,290
felt proud or
accomplished or guilty.

132
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,000
But I didn't directly feel
I was responsible for it.

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,570
But I didn't directly feel
I was responsible for it.

134
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,170
So I think that is the
primary distinguishing factor

135
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,750
between the emotional
palette in both.

136
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,440
 

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
As we were getting closer
to finishing the very

138
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,440
first version of The Sims--

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
we were of course bringing
people in, watching

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
them play it, just observing--

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,540
and as designers, we were
sitting back and watching

142
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,660
them play the game.

143
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,030
And as they were
playing the game

144
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,000
they were telling each other
the story of what was happening.

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,690
they were telling each other
the story of what was happening.

146
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,570
And it was hilarious.

147
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,400
I really enjoyed
hearing the stories.

148
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,010
And it was based upon what was
actually happening in the game,

149
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,130
but they would elaborate
and they would add details

150
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,280
and they gave it almost themes.

151
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,650
And it was just
fascinating to me

152
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,540
how readily people would
build a story around this.

153
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,300
I think it's a
fundamental way for us

154
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,290
to convey things to another
person is through story.

155
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,780
And so we decided that
we should-- at the very

156
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,280
last minute, we
decide we were going

157
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,200
to put a feature in so
players could basically

158
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,690
capture screenshots,
write text, and basically

159
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,000
build a little comic book, a
little illustrated comic book,

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,150
build a little comic book, a
little illustrated comic book,

161
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,470
and then upload
it with one click.

162
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,880
They didn't have to know
anything about the web.

163
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,490
It was just built into the game.

164
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,580
Capture a story, write it under
the pictures, press a button,

165
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,690
it goes on the web.

166
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,700
And so we had a section of our
website with player stories,

167
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,140
and it became immensely popular.

168
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,330
And initially it was kind
of predictable silly stories

169
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,730
about superheroes or whatever.

170
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,900
But very rapidly, we started
seeing these very heartfelt,

171
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,640
deep, real stories.

172
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,000
There was one of the early
ones was a woman who got out

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,450
There was one of the early
ones was a woman who got out

174
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,030
of an abusive relationship.

175
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,570
And she was trying
to tell that story

176
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,510
to inspire other women
in the same position.

177
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,240
Other ones were how this guy
had a horrible senior year

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,360
in high school.

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,610
Some of these were
just like almost rants.

180
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,440
One was a rant about
how they hated this one

181
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,360
particular Starbucks
in New York City

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,350
because the homeless
people would go in there

183
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,660
and drink the cream.

184
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,230
Just weird things like that.

185
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,720
It was amazing that these were
people that probably never

186
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,660
would have written these
things down at all.

187
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,410
They didn't really
have a creative outlet.

188
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,000
But once they started
playing the game

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,060
But once they started
playing the game

190
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,430
and they started actually
recreating these things

191
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,620
and they found how
easy it was to share,

192
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,360
and also these people
would post these stories

193
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,740
and other people would
comment about them, rate them.

194
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,370
And for a lot of
these people who've

195
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,990
never once been told
they were creative

196
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,200
or done anything interesting,
to just have five people,

197
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,480
random people, say
that was really cool,

198
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,860
made them tremendously
motivated.

199
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,060
They would go back and do
much more elaborate stories

200
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,680
after that.

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,150
It took very little positive
reinforcement or recognition

202
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,000
for these people to dive in.

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,490
for these people to dive in.

204
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,370
And obviously, these people had
things they wanted to express.

205
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,100
So basically, this game for them
turned into a creative tool,

206
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,750
a tool of self-expression.

207
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,880
And so we later kind of
developed that in The Sims

208
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,420
where you're capturing movies
and much more elaborate things.

209
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,840
And of course,
along side of games

210
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,100
there's been this really
interesting field of machinima

211
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,410
where people are actually
using game engines to tell

212
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,730
stories very, very cheaply.

213
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,030
And so that's something,
for the same reason,

214
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,190
has been growing up
along side of games
