3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,920
 Once I have an idea for a
game, I start making prototypes

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,300
as soon as I can.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,130
The early prototyping
is probably

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,900
the most important stage.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,150
We're trying to imagine
different types of rules

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,550
that might be
applied to the system

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,680
that we're basing the game on.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,510
You're basically
trying everything

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,000
you can think of for how to
turn this concept into a game,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,540
you can think of for how to
turn this concept into a game,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,210
whatever it takes for
you to cheaply get

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,070
a sense of that's
fun, that's not fun.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,370
Well, a prototype is
usually interactive.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,680
Not always, but usually.

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,010
And we're taking like some
little bit or part of the game

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,540
that we have a question about.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,100
Should we go this
way or that way?

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,450
And it might be an
interaction question.

23
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,450
Is it better to have the
controls work like this

24
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,000
or like that?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,490
or like that?

26
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,349
It might be a visualization
or a graphics question.

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,830
Should we do this point of
view, that point of view?

28
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,090
Should it be this
style, that style?

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,340
But it's something that we
feel like we can't answer

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,820
unless we actually touch
and play with and interact

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,570
with a little bit.

32
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,250
Even if it's just turning
the world around and looking

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,590
at different camera angles.

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,090
And that's when we
decide, OK, we're

35
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,700
going to build a
prototype and we're

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,060
going to build the simplest
possible thing we can

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,860
that will help us
answer that question.

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,270
As I'm playing with this
one little piece in hand

39
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,130
and imagining the rest
of the experience,

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,000
can answer that question?

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,240
can answer that question?

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,070
Oh yeah, this would be
much better top down.

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,630
This would be much better 3D.

44
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,170
This would be much better with
that kind of player control.

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,870
But you know, it really needs
to be answering a question

46
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,080
as cheaply as possible.

47
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,110
You don't want to go spend
weeks and weeks building this.

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,060
You want to build the cheapest,
simplest little thing that you

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,220
can build that you can
sit back and say, OK, I'm

50
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,530
pretty confident now
that we go this way.

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,050
As we get further down
the path, it's, you know,

52
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,970
can somebody learn how
to use this interface?

53
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,980
And we can find out what
the failure states are,

54
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,010
how we need to change it
to make it work better.

55
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,550
And even further
down the road, it's,

56
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,000
how engaging is this to players?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,590
how engaging is this to players?

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,320
And that's a much, much
more open-ended question

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,020
and a much broader
range of answers

60
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,100
that, for certain people,
this is very motivating.

61
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,300
Most people, it isn't.

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Or it's somewhat motivating
for a lot of people,

63
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,610
but if we did this, it would
be much more motivating.

64
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,030
Or, you know, the
social component

65
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,340
is working well here,
but not the individual.

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,170
So those are much more I'd
say subjective in terms

67
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,910
of interpreting the results.

68
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,150
The very initial ones are very
clear usually in terms of,

69
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,000
OK, we go with A instead
of B. And I think,

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,940
OK, we go with A instead
of B. And I think,

71
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,000
you know, we think
of it in those terms.

74
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,180
Prototyping can take
different forms.

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,010
I mean, sometimes it's cutting
up little pieces of paper

76
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,220
and these are now game units.

77
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,940
And you have, basically, rules,
and you can move your thing two

78
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,680
spaces every turn, and you might
have a very simple turn-based

79
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,890
two player game and you're
moving the pieces of paper

80
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,700
around.

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,330
Other times it might be a
more constructive experience

82
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,830
where you're actually drawing
something on a piece of paper,

83
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,000
and you have rules about
how much you can draw,

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,690
and you have rules about
how much you can draw,

85
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,220
and you add up how many
things you've drawn

86
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,930
and what the cost is,
and you're actually

87
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,330
doing your own little kind
of economic bookkeeping

88
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,960
along side of it.

89
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,790
You know, what we call paper
prototyping isn't so much

90
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,470
it has to be paper.

91
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,580
It really more means that
it's off the computer.

92
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,250
You know, you're not
really programming,

93
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,380
but you're doing it with
tangible little objects.

94
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,510
One thing that I tried
starting a long time ago

95
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,310
was when I was first
coming up with the game,

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,400
I was trying to pitch it
around, I would actually

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,150
make two or three different
box designs myself.

98
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,000
I'd just put, you know,
print the stuff out, glue it

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
I'd just put, you know,
print the stuff out, glue it

100
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,070
to the side of a box,
put them up there,

101
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,070
and show them to people.

102
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,180
Which one of these
games would you like?

103
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
It's all the same game
in my mind, but you know,

104
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,130
these are three different ways
of kind of informing, you know,

105
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,270
what the game is about
and presenting it.

106
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,130
In some sense, that's
a marketing prototype.

107
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,210
And I would see that, oh,
people really get box B,

108
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,710
but A and C they
don't like at all.

109
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,210
That would just
tell me a little bit

110
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,590
about how somebody initially
thinks about this whole idea

111
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,290
and which direction I should
go in terms of communicating.

112
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,660
So that's kind
of, in some sense,

113
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,800
a communications prototype.

114
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,000
Later on, as you
start kind of playing

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Later on, as you
start kind of playing

116
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,700
with how we present the player
or what's the interface,

117
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,000
you know, those are things
that are fairly simple.

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
And again, sometimes
these are things

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
you can just pull off
the shelf and say,

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,680
you know, this game
uses control scheme A,

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,520
that one uses control scheme B,
and they're both driving tanks.

122
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,480
Which one feels better?

123
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
As I'm imagining
the rest of my game,

124
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,720
which might be completely
different than these

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,620
off the shelf games.

126
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,250
But at least, in
terms of the controls,

127
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,220
I can sit there and imagine
my game with these controls.

128
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,520
So these prototypes
can take any form.

129

It's anytime you have
a question to answer

130

and you feel like if you
could build something,

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,940
and you feel like if you
could build something,

132
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,700
whether it's a fake box, or
a control scheme prototype,

133
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,490
or even two games off
the shelf that you're

134
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,910
playing one little
part of, will it

135
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,400
help you figure out which
branch down that design tree

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,320
that you want to take?

139
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,480
I found that when I make
games, a lot of times

140
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,220
it actually helps me to
build real, tangible things

141
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,000
from the game before I
actually build the game.

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,260
from the game before I
actually build the game.

143
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,550
When I was actually working
on "The Sims" at some point

144
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,550
I decided I wanted to
have a little neighborhood

145
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,620
for the original Sims.

146
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,950
And you would pick a
house and build a house,

147
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,060
and then eventually,
you'd build a little house

148
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,930
in the neighborhood.

149
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,840
I actually first built a real
model of a little, you know,

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,500
a few houses and a
little landscape.

151
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,750
And this is the model I
actually built for "The Sims."

152
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,800
And this is actually
the original Sims,

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,880
what it looked like.

154
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,760
So it was actually a fairly
close representation.

For "SimAnt" I
built a giant ant.

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,270
And for everything
I've made, I've

157
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,890
tried to bring it
to the tangible.

158
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,850
And it helps me think
about it in certain ways

159
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,000
when I'm actually touching it.

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,100
when I'm actually touching it.

161
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,600
And I wonder, like,
in the game, how

162
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,310
can I make it feel tangible?

163
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,870
How can I make the player
feel like they're actually

164
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,080
touching something real here?

166
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,450
 

167
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,820
As we start building prototypes,
we might find, you know,

168
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,700
kind of sweet spots,
really fun things.

169
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,110
That's a really cool
dynamic, or I like that tool,

170
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,890
or it's really enjoyable
making this thing.

171
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,720
Then we start figuring
out, how can we

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,730
take those really good
spots and spread it out

173
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,000
through the rest of the design
and make it part of the spine?

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,270
through the rest of the design
and make it part of the spine?

175
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,280
On a game like
"Spore," you know,

176
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,320
we started building some of
the editors very early on.

177
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,800
And it was so fun building
things in the creature editor,

178
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,350
we decided, hey, let's see if
we can do a building editor.

179
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,580
Oh, and that's cool, so we
can do a vehicle editor.

180
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,670
And so we decided
that the editors

181
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,320
would be consistent
across all the levels.

182
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,530
They would operate
pretty much the same,

183
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,210
but each one was its
own special thing.

184
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,940
But yet it was kind
of a core activity

185
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,970
that of gave connection
across the different levels.

186
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,000
Because "Spore," really,
you know, otherwise, was

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,220
Because "Spore," really,
you know, otherwise, was

188
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,870
like, five different games
that happened to be connected.

189
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,860
But the editors gave kind
of thematic consistency

190
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,750
across there.

191
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,810
And player familiarity.

192
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,440
When I got to the
next level, I already

193
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,790
knew how to use the editor.

194
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,460
So I think we look
for things like that.

195
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,590
Or you know, even like
the tools in "Sim City."

196
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,630
When you're laying down
this, you know, that tool

197
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,580
operates pretty much the
same like, you know, roads

198
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,530
operate almost the same
as the water pipes.

199
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,610
You look for things
that you can kind

200
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,980
of leverage across the design
so once the player learns

201
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,740
one thing, they've
learned five things.

202
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,860
But also gives kind
of a consistent

203
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,000
feel to the whole experience.

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,070
feel to the whole experience.

205
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

206
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,330
 

207
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, as a designer, I'm going
to look at these prototypes,

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,170
interact with them, and come up
with some decision about where

209
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,310
we should go.

210
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,330
I don't care what
they're built out of.

211
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,870
So typically, depending on the
programmer I was working with,

212
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,280
maybe they might
be very comfortable

213
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,530
throwing in a little code base
and they could very rapidly

214
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,100
iterate that.

215
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,630
So from my point
of view, whatever

216
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,570
was the least amount of friction
for the programmer creating

217
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,430
this.

218
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,000
Because at the end,
I just want to be

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,970
Because at the end,
I just want to be

220
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,050
able to interact with
it for a few hours

221
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,340
and then make a decision.

222
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,770
And we're basically going
to throw that code away.

223
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,140
Or the programmer might
actually take that code base

224
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,730
and evolve it into
the next prototype.

225
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,010
There's so many
different programs.

226
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,430
It could be, you
know, JavaScript.

227
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,390
It could be Unity.

228
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,140
It could be hardcore
C. I don't care, again.

229
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,070
But that really depends
a lot on, you know,

230
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,610
the programmer and
their familiarity.

231
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,980
You know, again,
whatever is going--

232
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,060
they can create the fastest
possible thing for you

233
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,420
at the least possible cost.

234
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,000
So I'm totally agnostic in terms
of what platform or code base

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,280
So I'm totally agnostic in terms
of what platform or code base

236
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,300
it's built in.

237
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,850
As a student, you want
to learn prototyping.

238
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,310
Again, I would say
find some system

239
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,210
that you can program to some
degree, or script, whatever

240
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,410
you're familiar with, and then
imagine how you could actually

241
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,230
create some simple interactive
experience with that.

242
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,410
Do that a few times.

243
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,880
And now start imagining, OK,
how could I make that better?

244
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,720
What questions do
I need to answer?

245
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,520
So basically, this, again, is a
navigation instrument for you.

246
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,370
It's a compass to
help you figure out,

247
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to go this
way or that way.

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
I want to go this
way or that way.

249
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,640
And just play with
simple rule sets.

250
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,530
You can kind of get
a sense of how you

251
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,130
navigate that kind of a tree.
