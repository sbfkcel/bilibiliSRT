[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,180
 

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,960
WILL WRIGHT: I don't actually
start by concepting a new game.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,090
I read a lot, I like learning
new things, and at some point

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,010
I'll just trip over a
subject or some material

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,350
that I find particularly
fascinating.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,270
So it's not like I sit
down and say, okay, I'm

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,260
going to come up
with a new game idea.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,890
It's more like I'm kind of just
exploring, browsing the world,

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,000
then it's like oh, maybe I
can make a game out of this.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,060
then it's like oh, maybe I
can make a game out of this.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,920
 

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,420
When I went to college I studied
all these different things,

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,070
and I don't want to
become an architect

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,350
or an engineer or an artist.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,480
And by being a game
designer, I found that I

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,070
could study whatever I want.

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,380
And my excuse is, I'm
making a game about it.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,650
So for me, being a game designer
turned into a lifelong learning

20
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,650
process where I can go
off in any subject I want

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,000
to and it's tax deductible.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
to and it's tax deductible.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,849
For me, it's usually some
kind of interesting thing

24
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,970
about the world or in the
world that as I dig deeper

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,100
it gets more
interesting, not less.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,720
It didn't sound that
interesting to me,

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
but as I read about
it a little bit more

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,770
it actually sounded
kind of fascinating.

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,020
I read some more and it actually
really grabbed me and pulled me

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,440
in.

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,980
A lot of the games
I've done actually

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,780
were based upon cool subjects,
usually books that I read.

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,580
SimCity was very
influenced by the work

34
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,780
of a guy named Jay Forrester
who was the first person

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,750
to actually model cities
on the early computers

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,000
back in the 50s.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
back in the 50s.

38
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,030
His models were
not spatial, they

39
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,280
were just like little numbers.

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,970
How many people
did the city have,

41
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,770
how much land, how many roads.

42
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,030
But he was actually
the father of what

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,820
became known as system
dynamics, which I'll

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,680
talk about a little bit later.

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,450
SimAnt was very much
inspired by the work

46
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,730
of Edward O Wilson, very famous
myrmecologist, studies ants.

47
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,900
He wrote this great book,
won the Pulitzer Prize,

48
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,650
called "The Ants".

49
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,720
But he actually, in
some sense, was reverse

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,510
engineering the way ants work.

51
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,260
Little ants are almost
like little robots,

52
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,770
and it's pretty
simple to figure out

53
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,000
in the presence
of this pheromone

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,280
in the presence
of this pheromone

55
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,450
the ant does that, in the
presence of that pheromone

56
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,250
he does this.

57
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,360
He actually reverse
engineered that and discovered

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,890
a whole level of emergence.

59
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,330
An ant colony, in fact,
is incredibly smart.

60
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,639
It's about as smart as a dog.

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,560
An individual ant is
incredibly stupid.

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,120
And so ant colonies
are really one

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,790
of the few forms of
intelligence that we

64
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,930
can deconstruct and
understand at that level,

65
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,520
and he was the guy who did it.

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,640
These kind of
subjects are things

67
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,220
that when you read about them,
they're kind of dry and boring,

68
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,120
they're filled with
technical jargon.

69
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,080
And what I always aspired to
do was to take these things

70
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
and make them approachable--
turn them into a toy.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,160
and make them approachable--
turn them into a toy.

72
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,890
How can I turn an
ant colony into a toy

73
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,100
so that people come in and
start interacting with it?

74
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,640
And when players are actually
manipulating these things

75
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,740
and building them,
they take ownership.

76
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,260
And they get so involved, so
much more emotionally connected

77
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,810
to these.

78
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,900
And then the subject
becomes utterly fascinating.

79
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,540
As soon as I built the very
first prototypes of SimCity

80
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,160
and I was running a
little simulation--

81
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,690
it was very coarse, very crude--

82
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,130
but still, my interest in
urban planning skyrocketed.

83
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,970
All of a sudden oh,
this is really cool.

84
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,260
I want to find out
about traffic modeling.

85
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,760
I want to find out about
this, that, and the other.

86
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,000
These things that would have
sounded incredibly boring to me

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,260
These things that would have
sounded incredibly boring to me

88
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,640
when I had a little Guinea
pig in my room to play with

89
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,810
became fascinating.

90
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,000
Likewise, other games
I did, The Sims,

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,940
was very much influenced by
Christopher Alexander's work

92
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,930
in architecture.

93
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,840
So for me personally, I find
a lot of inspiration in books,

94
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,130
also in fields I think that
are interdisciplinary, things

95
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,700
that are almost controversial.

96
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,450
Sim Earth was very much inspired
by James Lovelock's Gaia

97
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,080
hypothesis.

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,990
It's about the earth and
the way it regulates itself.

99
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,330
And usually that's where
the areas of science

100
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,000
are moving the fastest
and the most interesting.

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,630
are moving the fastest
and the most interesting.

102
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,880
And those are the things I
tended to gravitate toward.

103
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,030
This is me personally
as a designer.

104
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,670
I think every designer
is going to find

105
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,590
their own kind of
palette of inspiration,

106
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,460
their own direction,
their own kind of voice.

107
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:48,170
 

108
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,220
When I was starting
out in game design,

109
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,690
there wasn't this thing
around called the internet.

110
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,320
I actually had to go
to this place they

111
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,130
used to call
libraries where they

112
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,930
had these things called books.

113
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,000
And I would read these books
and learn about things that way.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,290
And I would read these books
and learn about things that way.

115
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,660
Nowadays, it's so low
friction to go on the web

116
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,230
and find anything you want to,
anything at all about anything

117
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,220
you want to.

118
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,350
So I think that now designers
have so much less friction

119
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,720
to do research around
an idea that for me it's

120
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,290
almost magical that I can
kind of pick any topic

121
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,000
and go down any
little weird path

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,970
and go down any
little weird path

123
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,680
and find material about it.

124
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,050
On the simulation side, it
was really interesting to me

125
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,600
to kind of go back into
the history of simulation,

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,060
back into the 60s and 50s
and even all the way back

127
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,640
to Von Neumann
and Turing and see

128
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,190
what they were trying to do
with these super primitive

129
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,820
computers.

130
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,690
And some of the things
they were trying to do

131
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,620
were amazing, way, way beyond
anything a computer could do.

132
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,950
But they would imagine that one
day a computer could do this.

133
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,360
And right now, my watch has
much more power than they

134
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,000
ever envisioned.

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,190
ever envisioned.

136
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,810
At least as a
designer, I don't feel

137
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,520
like there are any
meaningful limitations

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,780
beyond my own imagination.

139
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,470
And so I think to me,
that's really the thing

140
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,050
that I have to kind of
flex and exercise and push

141
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,520
is my own imagination.

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,300
If I could do
that, it's actually

143
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,880
pretty straightforward
and easy for me

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,170
to figure out the research,
the technology, to do it.

145
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,660
It feels to me like so
many designers always

146
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,030
think about and even
communicate their game

147
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,000
idea relative to other games.

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
idea relative to other games.

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,150
It's going to be World
of Warcraft on the moon.

150
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,370
It's going to be whatever.

151
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,910
I think that there's so
much more opportunity out

152
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,730
in the world to take things--

153
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,980
you can just take a rock off
the ground and look at it

154
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,950
the right way and it has
little microbes competing

155
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,930
on the surface for
territory, and there's

156
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,940
sunlight and environmental
consideration.

157
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,090
You could turn that into
something fascinating.

158
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,850
You can take almost anything,
and looking at it the right

159
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,710
way, make it a fascinating,
interactive experience.

160
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,000
 

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,790
 

162
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,000
With The Sims, it
wasn't really apparent

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,740
what I should be researching.

164
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,190
But as I started digging
into the game design,

165
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,570
we started getting into this
thing with the Sims motives,

166
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,490
and they had to go to
work and all this stuff.

167
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,410
It became pretty apparent
that this was really

168
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,660
kind of a game about time
management, in some sense,

169
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,560
on their side.

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,900
How do you manage their time
to maximize their motives

171
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,270
to make them happy?

172
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,890
And after quite
a bit of digging,

173
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,000
I came across the work of
a guy named James Robinson,

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,330
I came across the work of
a guy named James Robinson,

175
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,290
and he did all these time
studies of Americans,

176
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,370
how they spent their time.

177
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,860
He actually kept logs every day.

178
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,430
They spent 20 minutes of
time doing their stuff

179
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,930
in the morning to get ready.

180
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,430
This amount of time
with their kids.

181
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,170
This amount of time
in front of TV.

182
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,490
And he actually broke it down.

183
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,010
And it ended up that we were
matching those numbers fairly

184
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,880
closely.

185
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,790
We took the simulation and
tried to match the real numbers,

186
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,190
the percentage of time
that people actually

187
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,010
spend doing each of these
activities in The Sims.

188
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,000
So that was
something that wasn't

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,420
So that was
something that wasn't

190
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,090
apparent that was something
we could even research.

191
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,410
Another area of research--

192
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,160
I forgot the name of
the guy who did this,

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,830
but he was interviewing
all these people

194
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,020
about what their most
prized possessions were

195
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,340
at different ages.

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,200
And it was actually
quite interesting stuff,

197
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,430
some of which kind of
made it into the game,

198
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,300
some of which didn't.

199
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,180
It turned out that for
kids and really old people,

200
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,340
their most prized
possession was their bed.

201
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,790
And in mid-life--
and TV was second.

202
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,620
Mid-life it was like
their car, their house,

203
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,760
all these other things.

204
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
But it was interesting
that the kids list

205
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
of their top possessions
was almost the same

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,030
of their top possessions
was almost the same

207
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,700
as like an elderly
person's top possessions.

208
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,210
So some of this stuff will
become part of the game or not.

209
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,610
But still, as a designer,
if you understand and absorb

210
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,220
all this stuff, it helps
you think about directions

211
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,990
you might take it or
you could take it,

212
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,410
even if you don't
end up using it.

213
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,570
 

214
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,970
Even when I'm
initially imagining,

215
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,330
I'm making a game
about this thing,

216
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,900
I don't start by thinking
what's the game going to be

217
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,000
or what's going
to be like, I just

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
or what's going
to be like, I just

219
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,650
dive deeper and deeper into
the subject and the research.

220
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,460
And then I start trying to kind
of look at the components--

221
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,220
what are the different
aspects of this

222
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,620
that are interesting to me?

223
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,030
And it might be the process,
it might be the structure,

224
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,200
it might be the
science behind it,

225
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,710
whatever, historical context.

226
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,200
From those things,
I start imagining

227
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,590
how would I really like to view
this or manipulate it or play

228
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,000
with it or create it.

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,750
with it or create it.

230
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,299
If this is a piece
of clay, how do I

231
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,010
want to sculpt it,
what are my tools?

232
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,640
I start just imagining 10
or 20 different perspectives

233
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
on that subject.

234
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,750
And I think the
perspectives are far more

235
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,270
valuable than particular
solutions or approaches.

236
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,480
So actually, after kind of
rotating this thing around

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,210
through 20 or 30 perspectives,
two or three usually

238
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,280
will start to get
traction in my head,

239
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,620
and I'll start exploring
those a little bit further.

240
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,000
So I'm trying to describe
something that in my head

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,460
So I'm trying to describe
something that in my head

242
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,160
is really a much more
abstract process,

243
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,140
but that's how it feels to me.

244
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,470
But I in some sense, I'm
kind of circling the idea

245
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,840
and slowly zeroing in on it.

246
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,300
I don't dive right at it,
but I sit there and just

247
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,660
let it turn over my mind.

248
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,870
I'll sit there and do this
research thinking about it

249
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,530
phase for a year before I even
think about what kind of game

250
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,370
it might be.

251
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,030
And during that time, I
will even build models of it

252
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,000
or draw pictures of it or try to
recreate it in different forms,

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
or draw pictures of it or try to
recreate it in different forms,

254
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,430
tangibly.

255
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,410
And that again just
kind of puts my brain

256
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,240
in a little bit different
spin, a little bit

257
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,450
different perspective,
and new ideas

258
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,490
will pop up just
as a result of me

259
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,950
building a model of something.

260
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,100
 

261
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,230
Spore, the original concept,
was based on a couple of things.

262
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,450
I did a box design, an
original box design,

263
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,890
actually I called
it Sim Everything.

264
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,000
But there were two
things that really

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,650
But there were two
things that really

266
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,570
fascinated me especially.

267
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,340
Number one was an
old film, Charles

268
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,010
and Ray Eames "Powers of Ten".

269
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,530
FILM NARRATION: We begin
with a scene one meter wide.

270
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,440
Now every 10 seconds we
will look from 10 times

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,600
farther away, and our field of
view will be 10 times wider.

272
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,060
WILL WRIGHT: It
was the same thing.

273
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,910
Starting with an atomic scale,
every one a powers of 10

274
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,650
bigger and bigger and bigger.

275
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,560
I love that idea of
scale across the galaxy,

276
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,190
across the universe.

277
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,000
And within that
dimension of scale,

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,540
And within that
dimension of scale,

279
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,240
that the most interesting
thing at every single scale

280
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,210
that we know of is life.

281
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,010
Everything else is
fairly deterministic,

282
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,510
fairly predictable,
dry, but life

283
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,450
is the one unpredictable aspect
in every single scale starting

284
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,140
at the cellular level.

285
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,000
The other big inspiration
was basically astrobiology--

286
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,920
the idea of how prevalent
is life out the galaxy

287
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
and what forms might it take?

288
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,990
And so it was those two
ideas that came together

289
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,000
and I was really
thinking about, can I

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,300
and I was really
thinking about, can I

291
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,670
tell a story about
the journey of life

292
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,200
from the cellular level
up to galactic expansion

293
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,720
and make that kind of
game like, like a toy?

294
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:30,000
 

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,670
 

296
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,100
As a designer I tend to go with
my gut feel in terms of that's

297
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,320
going to be something cool, and
I can't always express exactly

298
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,900
on what dimensions
it's going to be cool,

299
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,360
but I hope that my instincts
will bring me to a place

300
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,080
where a wide range of
people will enjoy it.

301
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,000
And I wasn't always that way.

302
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,290
And I wasn't always that way.

303
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,620
It took me a while
to realize that.

304
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,040
When I was first working
on SimCity by myself

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,570
I showed it to a
few people and they

306
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,930
thought it was kind of cool.

307
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,030
I showed it to eventual
partner, Jeff Braun,

308
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,570
and he was like oh yes, we have
to do, let's start a company.

309
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,230
And we started Maxim
and did SimCity.

310
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,560
But in my mind, even at that
point, I was thinking okay,

311
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,350
this is a game that maybe a few
strategy gamers or architects

312
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,610
maybe might enjoy.

313
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,140
It didn't occur to me that
a wide range of people

314
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,850
would enjoy that.

315
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,500
To Jeff it did.

316
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,710
Jeff kind of understood that
I think more than I did.

317
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,920
After that, I started learning
to trust my instincts,

318
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,000
that if I really find
this cool for some reason

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,120
that if I really find
this cool for some reason

320
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,130
or I'm gravitating
toward that, just

321
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,130
trust that we can find a
way to bring other people

322
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,140
and they'll enjoy it as well.

323
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,760
It's very hard, as
a designer, for me

324
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
to design for somebody else.

325
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,850
This is how that person
thinks, this is what they want,

326
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,980
this is what they believe.

327
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,440
It's easy to do
for myself and then

328
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,200
figure out why am I enjoying
this, why am I motivated?

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,370
And what about other
people's thought process

330
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,070
will let them see this and
enjoy it and experience
