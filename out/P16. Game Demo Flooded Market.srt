1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,370
 

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,740
WILL WRIGHT (VOICEOVER): Now
let's check out another game

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,420
from a different
aspiring designer.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:17,910
 

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,560
 So my game is
"Flooded Market."

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,740
It's a multiplayer
strategy game where

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,200
you're going to enter
the cutthroat real estate

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,820
market of the sinking
city of San Francisco.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,320
 OK.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,800
 Yeah.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,000
 Cool.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,270
 Cool.

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,159
 So you're going to be
outbidding other players.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,390
You're going to be renting.

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,350
You're going to be
renovating these properties.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,860
And all the while, turn
by turn, climate change

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,800
is going to cause the
sea level to rise, as it

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,890
is in our starting screen.

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,910
 So this is fast
global warming.

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,410
 Yeah.

21
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,980
Accelerated global warming.

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,130
And as it moves up, it's going
to transform these properties

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,920
from their regular selves
into pristine, high quality,

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
beachfront property.

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,260
[LAUGHING]

26
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,140
And then destroy them
right afterwards.

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,000
And so you're trying to catch
that wave of inflated prices.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,240
And so you're trying to catch
that wave of inflated prices.

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,350
And that along with paying
off the right politicians

30
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,930
will let you--

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,180
 So this is multiplayer.

32
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,970
 It's multiplayer.

33
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,200
Up to 50 players
can play in a game.

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,940
We haven't tested
with 50 players.

35
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,220
But the system is
there to support it.

36
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,850
And the notion is that you
have all these players creating

37
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,890
an economy that you're
then going to try

38
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,420
to optimize and act inside of.

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,250
And, ideally, all
the player actions

40
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,030
are driving the simulation
while the simulation drives.

41
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,200
 Well, right off the bat,
I love your intro screen.

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,470
 Yeah.

43
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,060
 I mean, it looks
fun already, just

44
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,430
looking at the intro screen.

45
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:27,930
 Yeah.

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,000
The intro screen is to make
that striking first impression.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,810
The intro screen is to make
that striking first impression.

48
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,310
 OK.

49
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,890
So let's see the game.

50
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,390
 Yeah.

51
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,780
Let's get into it.

52
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,620
So you're playing.

53
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,640
We're going to
create a game here.

54
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,930
 I like the pitch, by the way.

55
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,780
I mean, it's very
succinct, concise.

56
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,600
And it sounds fun.

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,850
 Name this Will's Game.

58
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,810
So we're going to
launch in here.

59
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,430
So right now we're
going to kind of get

60
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,390
the gist, the lay of the land.

61
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,100
There's San Francisco, for
those who recognize it.

62
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,050
WILL WRIGHT: So you have a
real map of the real city.

63
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,340
GAME DESIGNER: Right.

64
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,470
Yeah.

65
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,210
We pulled from map
data to help get

66
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,270
elevations and locations,
and also house prices

67
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,020
to start off with.

68
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,320
WILL WRIGHT: All right.

69
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
GAME DESIGNER: So we
have a house downtown

70
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
that's worth $1.3 million.

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,460
that's worth $1.3 million.

72
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,330
It's five stars.

73
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,600
WILL WRIGHT: Are these
all things for sale?

74
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,550
GAME DESIGNER: These
are all things for sale.

75
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah.

76
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,310
 So I have a budget.

77
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,350
And I'm choosing how to spend,
invest in real estate here.

78
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,560
GAME DESIGNER: That's right.

79
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,060
Yeah.

80
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,389
You have $3.8 million up here.

81
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,789
And let's say we could
even select this house.

82
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,550
We can bid on it.

83
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,230
This one, we can take
a look at, and say, OK.

84
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,430
It's got some nice views.

85
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,510
It's got a decent quality.

86
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,070
We can upgrade that
later if we want.

87
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,840
It's kind of getting
close to the water.

88
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,520
20% water level.

89
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,270
WILL WRIGHT: Yeah.

90
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,730
GAME DESIGNER: We can check.

91
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,150
Its elevations at 50 meters.

92
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,610
The water right
now is at 0 meters.

93
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,240
But that'll change as
soon as the turn ends,

94
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,300
which is fast approaching.

95
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,970
 So this turn based?

96
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,720
 Turn based game.

97
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,000
 OK.

98
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,220
 OK.

99
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,180
GAME DESIGNER: So we can
also place a bid here.

100
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,590
And then our first property.

101
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:33,980
What are you thinking?

102
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,940
Do you want to list it?

103
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,480
Get rid of it?

104
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,180
Do you want to upgrade it?

105
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,340
Do you want to start renting?

106
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,550
WILL WRIGHT: Let's upgrade it.

107
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,910
GAME DESIGNER: OK.

108
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,100
So we're going to put
that up to six stars.

109
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,850
And now it jumped
to $1.4 million.

110
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,250
 But I really want to
go one turn to see how

111
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,340
far up the water's going to go.

112
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,630
GAME DESIGNER: Oh yeah.

113
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,130
Yeah.

114
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,710
So we can zoom out, if
I can zoom out here.

115
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,310
So the water only
went up two meters.

116
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,140
So we got some time.

117
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,180
That will increase
as the game goes on.

118
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,930
So it will be kind of
this building clock.

119
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,390
 So I'm guessing there's kind
of like a sweet spot I want

120
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,560
to get in here where
I hold it long enough

121
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
for it to appreciate right
before it's inundated.

122
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,820
for it to appreciate right
before it's inundated.

123
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,320
 Yeah.

124
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,090
Exactly.

125
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,800
And it takes a couple
turns to kind of do

126
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,050
the actions you want, to
kind of flip these houses.

127
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,670
And so--

128
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,410
 Now, am I buying and selling
these houses to other players,

129
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,370
or from the computer?

130
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,040
 So you're doing both.

131
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,420
If no one bids on it, the
computer will pick up the slack

132
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:14,920
and buy it.

133
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,810
There's kind of this secret
economy guy who's making sure

134
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,890
that everyone gets paid.

135
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,430
 Right.

136
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,520
 But other players can buy
your house once you list it.

137
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,020
 OK.

138
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,360
 And so right now we have--

139
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,090
if we zoom out, we have all
these different player icons.

140
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,490
And those are all the
49 other AI players

141
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,580
that are playing with us.

142
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,750
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

143
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,000
GAME DESIGNER: And so
if I hit the End Turn,

144
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,620
GAME DESIGNER: And so
if I hit the End Turn,

145
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,270
you'll see them actually
kind of run around.

146
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,970
So they all move around the map,
buying and selling properties.

147
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,230
We can also do that.

148
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,910
These green properties are
the properties we can move to.

149
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,150
They're adjacent to downtown.

150
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,600
So we can hop over
here to Civic Center.

151
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,060
And now we have new properties
that we can buy in, new

152
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,470
neighbors we can buy
in, and new properties--

153
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,540
or new neighborhoods we can--

154
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,260
 Oh, so we have a
location in this world.

155
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,560
 Yeah.

156
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,890
We have this tiny little avatar.

157
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,010
 And so that's going
to buy stuff near me.

158
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,510
 Right.

159
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,450
 OK.

160
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,230
 So right now we're trying
to incorporate as much player

161
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,650
to player interaction
as possible.

162
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,150
 Right.

163
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,000
 Right now they're kind of
using this middleman that's

164
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,740
 Right now they're kind of
using this middleman that's

165
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,430
the simulation.

166
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,780
So I buy and sell properties.

167
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,280
I can upgrade and
affect properties.

168
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,960
And then other players can
interact with those properties.

169
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,140
But I can't interact
with players so much.

170
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,010
I can outbid them.

171
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,580
 Right.

172
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,320
 And if we--

173
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
 I presume you played "Mule."

174
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
 I have played "Mule."

175
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,390
 Way, way back.

176
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,220
And they had that cool
auction interaction.

177
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,490
 Yeah.

178
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:17,829
Yeah.

179
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:17,990
No.

180
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,560
That was--

181
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,790
 I'm almost
expecting, you know,

182
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,380
some kind of like exciting
point here where I'm

183
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,030
trying to bid with other
players for a property that's

184
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,080
very desirable.

185
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,430
 I think showcasing that might
be a good direction to go.

186
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,000
Or creating some sort of
moment where everyone's

187
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,430
Or creating some sort of
moment where everyone's

188
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,640
throwing money at each other.

189
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,450
 Dramatic tension.

190
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,860
Yeah.

191
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,020
 Yeah.

192
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah.

193
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,910
And that could be
broadcasted out

194
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,540
to other players, where they get
to watch this battle of bucks

195
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,890
and dollars go back and forth.

196
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,150
 Right.

197
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,480
It was actually also an
interesting combination

198
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,040
of kind of turn
based and real time.

199
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,220
 Yeah.

200
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,440
That's true.

201
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,110
 Because that part of
the auction was real time.

202
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,940
The rest of it was turn based.

203
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,100
 Yeah.

204
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,440
Yeah.

205
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah.

206
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,710
So you had this constant
tension between whether or not

207
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,880
you were paying attention
to the real time

208
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,780
component of the game.

209
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,050
 Yeah.

210
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,210
So and I'm playing this
online against other players?

211
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,810
 You would be playing this.

212
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:53,870
Yeah.

213
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,940
 How long is a turn?

214
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,120
 So a turn is an average
of about 35 seconds.

215
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
In early turns you
have more time.

216
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,540
In early turns you
have more time.

217
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,040
 Oh.

218
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,640
So it's fast.

219
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,210
 It's fast.

220
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah.

221
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,530
In the early turns
you have more time.

222
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,610
You have 45 seconds.

223
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,650
And then near the end of the
game you have about 25 seconds.

224
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,820
 So that's a lot of
your dramatic tension

225
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,960
is how much you can
accomplish in 35, 40 seconds.

226
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,460
 Right.

227
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,830
I'm not sure how
much of the game

228
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,220
I want to be about
time management.

229
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,720
 Right.

230
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,630
 I would like players to
feel comfortable enough

231
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,670
with the time they're
given to make the decisions

232
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,530
and choices they have.

233
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,740
 Right.

234
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,490
 So that was one of the
reasons why we limited it

235
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,350
to five properties.

236
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,520
So right now we have
two of five max.

237
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,220
 Much easier to--

238
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,550
 Yeah.

239
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,140
Previously you
didn't have a limit.

240
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,710
And I got up to 40 properties.

241
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,000
And so I had 45 seconds to make
decisions on 40 properties.

242
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,550
And so I had 45 seconds to make
decisions on 40 properties.

243
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,710
And I was having a very
stressful time of it.

244
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,500
 Tell me a little bit about
what you've learned in testing.

245
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,280
 So we've learned that
people really like--

246
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,070
they see houses
almost like people.

247
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,580
 OK.

248
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,390
 They see houses as having
identities and having stories,

249
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,180
and locations as having
those identities and stories.

250
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,660
They see this as a tragedy
playing out before them.

251
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,160
Right.

252
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,770
This is a train wreck happening.

253
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,050
And they're trying to
profit from it, which is

254
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,350
uncomfortable for some people.

255
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,360
 You know, I think it's
going to have a whole lot

256
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,000
to do with the pacing of it.

257
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,220
to do with the pacing of it.

258
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,720
 OK.

259
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,790
 You know, 35 seconds.

260
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,000
Is a new player going to
feel like it's overwhelming.

261
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,910
All the other people know
exactly what they're doing.

262
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,070
 Yeah.

263
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,000
 And I haven't even
started in 35 seconds.

264
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,180
 Yeah.

265
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,240
Yeah.

266
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,600
Exactly.

267
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,530
 Is there some way to
kind of moderate that?

268
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,030
 Yeah.

269
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,960
Some delicate onboarding is
probably a good next step.

270
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,060
Because that'll also let
us get to new testers

271
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,620
without having to
sit them all down,

272
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,540
like the, and walk them
through all the steps.

273
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,080
 I'm just wondering.

274
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,310
I've never really
seen a game like this.

275
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
But I could almost
imagine something

276
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,680
where you're interleaving.

277
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,820
The new players are in certain
zones where they get a minute.

278
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,650
And one of their turns
is equal to two turns

279
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,000
of an experienced player.

280
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,570
of an experienced player.

281
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:30,990
 Oh.

282
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,400
So we could--

283
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,120
 And so you keep
it in lockstep.

284
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,990
But the new players
actually get longer.

285
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,260
And they're on the
same time cycle.

286
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,180
But it's kind of interleaved.

287
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,680
 Yeah.

288
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:38,950
Yeah.

289
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

290
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,130
And maybe they're--

291
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,820
OK.

292
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,670
I can certainly see some really
interesting balance point

293
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,420
being reached, that
we could even use them

294
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,480
as the generators of
content for the players who

295
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,570
are playing faster games.

296
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,440
So instead of having that
invisible economic agent

297
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,210
behind the--

298
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,420
 And maybe they're buying
the cheaper properties.

299
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,960
Maybe the residential properties
are on this every other turn

300
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,540
time scale.

301
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:57,630
 Yeah.

302
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,400
 You have a minute.

303
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,610
When you get into
the more expensive

304
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,000
commercial properties,
it's every 30 seconds.

305
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,620
commercial properties,
it's every 30 seconds.

306
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,720
And that's the
experience player.

307
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:02,880
 Yeah.

308
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,380
Yeah.

309
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,020
And so we have a way for them
to play together, but also

310
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,220
at their own pace.

311
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,460
 At their own pace.

312
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,380
And they don't feel
like they're-- you know,

313
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,100
it doesn't feel too fast
for the beginning player,

314
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,570
or too slow for the
experienced player.

315
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,350
 I hadn't thought of that.

316
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,090
 I grew up playing
turn based games.

317
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,770
And some of these like, you
know, turn based war games,

318
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,310
I'd spend an hour sitting there,
planning every little thing.

319
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,140
You know, other times
they go a lot faster.

320
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,370
But when you're having to
wait for other players,

321
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,990
and I've done all my
stuff in 30 seconds,

322
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,210
and I'm waiting for the five
minute turn to end, you know,

323
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,050
it's incredibly boring.

324
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,450
 [INAUDIBLE]

325
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,870
 So I think
figuring out some way

326
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,000
to where players can
kind of select the time

327
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,300
to where players can
kind of select the time

328
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,010
scale at which
they're comfortable,

329
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,710
which also might be the level
of experience or risk, you know,

330
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,480
that they're
encountering in the game.

331
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
Can I zoom in to the
visuals, like where

332
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,190
the water's coming up?

333
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,580
 Oh yeah.

334
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,150
 I just want to--

335
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,660
 Let's get in there.

336
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:42,720
 

337
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,530
 Oh, yeah.

338
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,250
That's cool.

339
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,030
I like this.

340
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,270
GAME DESIGNER: Yeah.

341
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,960
So we can look around.

342
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,640
 Can you rotate the map?

343
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,220
Or is it--

344
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,660
 Right now it's staying
north to west to southeast.

345
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,420
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

346
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,290
GAME DESIGNER: And staying
kind of locked there.

347
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,950
WILL WRIGHT: But I can
kind of zoom in and see,

348
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,630
this is where I live while
the water's coming at you.

349
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:54,700
GAME DESIGNER: Yeah.

350
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:54,710
Yeah.

351
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,520
Look at that part.

352
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
 You know, you mentioned
right at the beginning

353
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
that some players found
it a little macabre, or--

354
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,020
that some players found
it a little macabre, or--

355
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,000
 A little distressing.

356
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,580
 Distressing.

357
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,090
 Yeah.

358
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,320
 I find that interesting.

359
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,100
And actually, I think
that's kind of cool.

360
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,430
Because that indicates a level
of emotional involvement,

361
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,620
that they're emotionally
involved in what this is.

362
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,370
Back when Kubrick did "Dr.
Strangelove," way back,

363
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,310
a lot of people criticized him
for making fun of nuclear war.

364
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,780
But at the same
time, he actually

365
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,750
got a whole generation
of kids, you

366
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,210
know, aware of how
stupid nuclear war was.

367
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,690
 And emotionally
invested in it.

368
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,160
 By making a dark
comedy about it.

369
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,620
You know.

370
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,120
 Yeah.

371
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,820
 And I think that's one of the
things that really attracts me

372
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,000
to this concept.

373
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,990
to this concept.

374
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,570
I think that the turn based
thing is kind of old school,

375
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,190
but it has a lot of
cool opportunities.

376
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,039
I really enjoy
turn based gaming.

377
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,890
And I think that there
might be some opportunities

378
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,110
to kind of do things
with turn based gaming

379
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,540
that haven't been done before.

380
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,080
And I think, in some
sense, you might

381
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,540
be able to attract a lot
more players to it, because--

382
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,780
 If I have a spin
on that kind of thing

383
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,070
that they're expecting.

384
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,660
 Yeah.

385
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,860
And keep it
approachable like this.

386
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,360
 Yeah.

387
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,900
 But I think it's a
very cool, unique idea.

388
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,940
And I think that, you
know, the biggest challenge

389
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,000
I would see right off the
bat is going to be moderating

390
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,660
I would see right off the
bat is going to be moderating

391
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,760
the player involvement
and skill level such

392
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,130
that new players don't feel
overwhelmed by the pace

393
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,670
of the game.

394
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,170
 Yeah.

395
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,460
 Or the opportunities
that the other players

396
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,370
are taking from them.

397
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,670
You know, that you don't have
the experienced players preying

398
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,420
on the newbies.

399
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,920
 Right.

400
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,470
Right.

401
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,120
 But I really like the idea.

402
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,270
And I think your pitch was
very effective and intriguing

403
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,050
as well.

404
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,130
Cause right off the bat, you
didn't really talk about genre.

405
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,130
You just kind of talked
about, here's the topic.

406
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,810
Here's how it plays.

407
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,810
And in my mind, I was
starting to play the game.

408
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,690
And it sounded fun.

409
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,400
So and I think
it's a great idea.

410
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,000
And I think you'll
learn a lot, you

411
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,150
And I think you'll
learn a lot, you
