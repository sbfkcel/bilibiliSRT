1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100

00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,480
WILL WRIGHT (VOICEOVER): A
lot of aspiring game designers

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,300
come to me with ideas
and their designs.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,430
And I'm very familiar
with kind of looking

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,530
at them with fresh eyes,
and maybe giving them

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,210
a different perspective on
where they might go with it.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,390
So we've invited an
aspiring game designer

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,540
to come share a game she's
currently working on.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,340
I'll be looking at
her game, trying

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,410
to get a sense of where
she wants to go with it,

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,010
and giving her feedback on it.

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,000
 

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,470
 

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,420
 So "Morey" is a side
scrolling puzzle platformer.

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,920
 OK.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,020
 And the premise
is that you play

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,520
as this woman named Nina who has
been stranded on this abandoned

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,610
space colony.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,190
And she's trying to
find the equipment

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,800
she needs to get back home.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,300
 OK.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,860
 So the gameplay is definitely
like a traditional Metroidvania

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,260
game.

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,760
 All right.

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,540
 And the premise, a
lot of the upgrades

27
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,820
are you're changing
around gravity.

28
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,810
 Changing gravity?

29
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,000
 Yes.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,440
 Yes.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,510
So you can change it
up, down, left, right.

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,879
 So you're jumping, and
the gravity allows you--

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,050
OK.

34
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,810
Let's take a look at it.

35
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,410
 Sure.

36
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,600
We can take a look here.

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,500
So as you can see, we've
entered this giant room.

38
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,180
And you can change
gravity around.

39
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,430
WILL WRIGHT: Oh, you're
changing the angle of gravity.

40
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,510
GAME DESIGNER: Yes Yeah.

41
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,780
WILL WRIGHT: Oh.

42
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,280
I see.

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,920
OK.

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,050
GAME DESIGNER: So if you
fall too far, you can die.

45
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,580
So that's kind of
like the main thing.

46
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,650
 Because the camera
doesn't rotate.

47
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,890
So you have to
turn in your head.

48
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,390
OK.

49
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,090
 Right.

50
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,960
 All right.

51
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,040
 So at this point,
she's just kind of--

52
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,000
 So you're actually
pressing something on here

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,480
 So you're actually
pressing something on here

54
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,330
to change gravity?

55
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,160
And you can pick one
of the four directions?

56
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,540
 Yes.

57
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,040
Exactly.

58
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,600
 All right.

59
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,690
I mean, right off the
bat, looking at this game,

60
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,210
it looks cooler to me now
than when you first pitched it

61
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,100
to me just a few seconds ago.

62
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,600
You started by saying it's a
side scrolling, da, da, da, da,

63
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,340
da.

64
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,960
Immediately in my
head I think Mario.

65
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,460
Whatever.

66
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,580
It brings a lot of baggage.

67
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,640
 Sure.

68
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,350
 I think-- and I
don't really care about

69
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,220
the character's name.

70
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,120
But if you say she's stranded
on this ship, exploring it,

71
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,300
but she gets altered
gravity, all of a sudden

72
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
that sounds kind of interesting,
intriguing, something

73
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,000
I've never heard.

74
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,290
I've never heard.

75
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,500
I think maybe just start
with that and seeing it,

76
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,450
and now it looks just
so much cooler to me.

77
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,950
 OK.

78
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,770
 And I like the
style a lot too.

79
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,280
 Thank you.

80
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,060
 

81
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,560
Yeah.

82
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,020
So the idea is you are
running around trying to find

83
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,460
like scraps that you need.

84
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,000
WILL WRIGHT: It's a bit dark.

85
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,050
And that's part of
the game mechanics

86
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,530
is that you really need a
light to kind of see things?

87
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:18,890
GAME DESIGNER: Yes.

88
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:18,960
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

89
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,580
 So one of the mechanics,
or one of the things

90
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,620
you're upgrading is that
eventually you'll find a light.

91
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,550
You don't always start with it.

92
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,840
 All right.

93
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,900
 So there's like
a lot of danger

94
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,670
of just kind of wandering
around in the darkness.

95
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,010
 In the dark.

96
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,360
OK.

97
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,860
Yeah.

98
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,530
 Mhm.

99
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,000
 Now, I'm not
hearing any sound.

100
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,900
 Now, I'm not
hearing any sound.

101
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,850
Is that just part of the game
you haven't developed yet?

102
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,360
 Right.

103
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Exactly.

104
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,140
 OK.

105
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,040
Because I think
when you're dealing

106
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,960
with limited perception,
like this flashlight,

107
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,660
sound is going to be
a huge part of that.

108
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,330
You hear something
scary or creaking.

109
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,490
You don't know if
it's good or bad.

110
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,210
It might be a door.

111
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,000
Or it might be a monster.

112
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,630
Who knows what?

113
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,240
But I think the
sound is going to be

114
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,590
just as important as the
visuals for a game like this.

115
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,090
 Oh, yeah.

116
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,660
Definitely.

117
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,310
Especially when you're
running around in the dark.

118
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,820
 Exactly.

119
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,100
But that's one of your
primary senses now.

120
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,910
 So yeah.

121
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,870
For this puzzle specifically,
you're supposed to like go up,

122
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,360
and these boxes
will fall upward.

123
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,000
And then you have to like
race to finish the other side

124
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,650
And then you have to like
race to finish the other side

125
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,770
before they fall back down.

126
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,420
 OK.

127
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,890
 So that would be
a huge part of where

128
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,100
sound is going to be like in.

129
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,860
 And it feels like you
should do that fairly soon,

130
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,530
because you've obviously
pretty established here

131
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,520
on the visuals and some
of the game mechanics.

132
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,540
And if you're lacking
the sound, you're

133
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,470
lacking like 30% of the
experience right now.

134
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,910
So even if you just kind
of stub in some sound,

135
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,660
I would stub it in as
quickly as possible.

136
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,230
 Sure.

137
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,990
OK.

138
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,490
Yeah.

139
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,500
So that's like-- it's
a pretty short demo.

140
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,650
 OK.

141
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,820
 So if you want to play it.

142
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,460
 What was the
inspiration for this?

143
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah.

144
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
Let me move it around.

145
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, I just moved
gravity way over there.

146
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,710
Oh, I just moved
gravity way over there.

147
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,690
Oh, I killed myself.

148
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,230
Oh, so that's how
you change gravity.

149
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,780
Right?

150
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,280
 Yeah.

151
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,360
So WASD is to move.

152
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,150
 Oh, gotcha.

153
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,650
Oh, gotcha.

154
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,520
OK.

155
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,350
GAME DESIGNER: So I love games
like "Limbo" and "Inside."

156
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,890
Oh, you might have
disappeared there.

157
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,930
WILL WRIGHT: Oh, I forgot
that I can go that way.

158
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,940
 Oh, jeez.

159
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,060
WILL WRIGHT: This is actually
kind of fun, failing.

160
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,130
 Good.

161
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,850
That's excellent.

162
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,150
 No.

163
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,610
I think that's actually, for
me, one of the important parts

164
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,460
is not just that I'm
failing, but it's

165
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,630
presented in a humorous way.

166
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,060
I think humor is
one of the really

167
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,000
superpowers that game designers
have at their disposal.

168
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,510
superpowers that game designers
have at their disposal.

169
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,620
They don't always use.

170
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,160
A lot of times people
will be looking

171
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,650
for extremely elaborate
technical solutions

172
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,680
to something, where, in fact,
just a little bit of humor

173
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
can solve it.

174
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,600
There was a door there.

175
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:11,900
Right?

176
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,560
Or maybe not.

177
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,810
So if I change gravity--

178
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,980
GAME DESIGNER: If you can
make it to the other side,

179
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,610
there's a door.

180
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,560
WILL WRIGHT: Oh, I see.

181
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,230
OK.

182
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,410
 You will-- those
boxes are deadly.

183
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,540
 Yeah.

184
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,160
I really do like the
look of the world.

185
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,500
I notice, there's
almost like a raster

186
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,980
scan quality to
the graphics here.

187
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,870
Is that on purpose?

188
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,660
GAME DESIGNER: Yes.

189
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,000
So that is a post
processing effect.

190
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,320
So that is a post
processing effect.

191
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,310
WILL WRIGHT: Yeah.

192
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,920
 So the idea is-- and this will
kind of unfold in the story--

193
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,730
that you're being
watched by somebody.

194
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,230
 OK.

195
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,680
 So I wanted to
do an effect that

196
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,220
was sort of subtle, like maybe
you didn't notice it at first.

197
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,720
 Right.

198
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,430
 And the story would kind of
give you meaning to it later.

199
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,360
 All right.

200
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,850
And so one of your
primary mechanics

201
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,900
here is changing gravity.

202
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,400
 Right.

203
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,940
 The orientation of gravity.

204
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,060
Which seems like a pretty
rich thing to explore.

205
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,020
How much have you tried
different level designs

206
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,430
against that?

207
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,780
I mean, do you have like a
level editor right now for this?

208
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,690
 So yeah.

209
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,000
The system is set up so I can
pretty easily build things out.

210
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,490
The system is set up so I can
pretty easily build things out.

211
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:02,990
 Right.

212
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,410
 And that's where
I've just gotten.

213
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,860
So I've just gotten to the point
where like the vertical slice

214
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,340
is complete.

215
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,900
 Because it kind of feels
like you have a fairly open

216
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,280
ended design space
now of how to play

217
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,840
with that mechanic
of changing gravity.

218
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,260
 Exactly.

219
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,570
 And now, as a designer, what
you want to be doing is trying

220
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,960
a lot of different
level designs,

221
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,380
just experimenting to find out
which ones really work with

222
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,460
that and which ones don't.

223
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,340
And that's going to be a lot
of learning on your part.

224
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,570
 Right.

225
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,130
 You know.

226
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,480
And then kind of leaning
into the ones that

227
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,460
work well so that
you're really maximizing

228
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,930
that dynamic, the game mechanic.

229
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,880
 Yeah.

230
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,000
 You know, I think that and
the sound design feel like,

231
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,670
 You know, I think that and
the sound design feel like,

232
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,290
to me, the two areas you should
really be focusing on right now

233
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,160
as a designer.

234
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,440
Have you put this in
front of other people?

235
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,010
 Yes.

236
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,280
 All right.

237
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,890
 Yes.

238
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,300
 And what is the most
typical confusing thing

239
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
at first for a new player?

240
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,460
 So in my initial
play tests, I think

241
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,580
I had puzzles that were probably
more complicated than a game

242
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,660
like this needed to be.

243
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,160
 OK.

244
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,850
 So it was a lot
of struggle to get

245
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,790
through those mechanic wise.

246
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,520
Like I haven't found
people being frustrated

247
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,000
with the gravity and stuff.

248
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,210
with the gravity and stuff.

249
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,300
 And is this basically
kind of a puzzle game

250
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,500
where there's one solution?

251
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,920
You have to, you know, unlock
that door, unlock that door?

252
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,500
Kind of a gated experience?

253
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,090
 Right.

254
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,520
And that's something I kind
of have to test out still,

255
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,660
because part of the mechanic
is you can jump around

256
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,660
to any part of the ship.

257
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,160
Right.

258
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,490
Once you find these checkpoints.

259
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:17,990
 All right.

260
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,510
 So theoretically you could
run through a puzzle backwards.

261
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,010
 All right.

262
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,960
 And so it still has to be
like solvable to get back.

263
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,460
 Right.

264
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,050
That makes the design thing
a little bit more tricky.

265
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,570
 Right.

266
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,880
Exactly.

267
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,000
 Hm.

268
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,380
 Hm.

269
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,750
And just in your overall vision
of this as a product, how long

270
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,750
do you think an average
player's going to spend,

271
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,730
playing this all
the way through?

272
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,250
 I'm aiming for
about three hours.

273
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,830
 Three hours?

274
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,180
OK.

275
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,530
 A pretty short experience.

276
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,180
Yeah.

277
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,640
 Well, that's
fairly long, though.

278
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,200
I mean, for this
kind of puzzle game.

279
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,700
 OK.

280
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,730
 You know, do you have
a sense of how many

281
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,680
levels, or how big
of a space you're

282
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,170
going to have to
build out for it

283
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,510
to be a three hour experience?

284
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,570
 So how I've been
thinking about it is I

285
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,220
broke it down by each of the
upgrades that you're getting.

286
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,780
 All right.

287
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,300
 And based on the
upgrade, my thought

288
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,000
is like, OK, well, how
cool is this upgrade?

289
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
is like, OK, well, how
cool is this upgrade?

290
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,530
And how much time do I really
want to make the player--

291
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,150
 Right.

292
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,900
 Like to earn it.

293
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,310
 And tell me what happens
when you get these upgrades.

294
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,830
Do they actually change
your abilities in the game?

295
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,490
Like you were talking about
getting a better flashlight,

296
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,380
and stuff like that.

297
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,800
 They will change
your abilities.

298
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,230
Like the gravity ability
itself is something

299
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,110
that you will unlock.

300
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,610
 Oh, I see.

301
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,110
OK.

302
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,960
So as you move forward
through this ship,

303
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,630
you get to places
where you have to have

304
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,310
these upgrades to complete
the level, presumably.

305
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,000
 Exactly.

306
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,500
 OK.

307
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,030
 Yeah.

308
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,630
 And is it always going to
be basically kind of a linear,

309
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,390
I need this.

310
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,950
Then I open B. Then I need that.

311
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,000
And then I open C?

312
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,050
And then I open C?

313
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,490
Or is there some
combinations that

314
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,970
can give you shortcuts or
different paths through there?

315
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,260
Because that would make it
a much more replayable game.

316
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,680
 Right.

317
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,060
 And that's kind of a big
question between how much time

318
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,270
do you want to spend
opening more player

319
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,320
opportunities in this, versus
having it be replayable,

320
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,820
you know.

321
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm not sure if
this is something

322
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,730
you intend a player just to
sit down, play for three hours,

323
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,480
and then put away.

324
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,490
That was fun.

325
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,750
Or if it's something, you
know, where you want them--

326
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,940
you're going back
and trying it again.

327
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,440
You know, in some
of the Mario games

328
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,150
if you collect all
the coins on a level,

329
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,550
you know, you get
other things unlocked.

330
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,050
You know.

331
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,000
So that's something you
could think of down the road.

332
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,410
So that's something you
could think of down the road.

333
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,980
You don't have to
think of right now.

334
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,620
But in terms of the
overall player experience,

335
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,180
I think you should
be thinking about.

336
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,160
 I have thought about,
at least in the sense

337
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,960
I do like the idea of
them like strategizing.

338
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,480
Cause when you look
at the map, you

339
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,070
can see where like the scrap
is that you need to collect.

340
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,570
 Right.

341
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,200
 So you can like know that, OK,
well, this part of the ship I'm

342
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,120
being blocked because I
can't do this ability.

343
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,620
 Right.

344
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,100
 And there's all
that scrap there.

345
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,230
And then maybe this part
of the ship is also locked,

346
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,360
and there's all this scrap.

347
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,150
So they have to judge like
what is the best thing for them

348
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,000
to do at that moment.

349
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,610
to do at that moment.

350
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,220
 Yeah.

351
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,950
Hm.

352
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,450
Huh.

353
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,169
Interesting idea.

354
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,340
You know, I think that--

355
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,600
and just one last question.

356
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,419
Is the gravity thing like
your primary game dynamic?

357
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,940
Is that really what you
think distinguishes this game

358
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,130
versus other games like this?

359
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,840
 Yeah.

360
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,340
Yeah.

361
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,990
 OK.

362
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,360
And, you know, obviously
you have some back story.

363
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,570
But that's, you know, the
back story that everybody's

364
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,570
going to have obviously.

365
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,550
But I think that you
could do a whole lot

366
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,390
with sound design in this
that I'm not seeing right now.

367
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,930
I think that you
have the opportunity

368
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,560
to do a lot of really
interesting level design.

369
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,390
But you're going
to have to explore

370
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,000
that space as a designer.

371
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
that space as a designer.

372
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,410
You know, and whatever you're
using for a level editor,

373
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,020
you want to make as, you know,
kind of seamless and easy

374
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,170
to use as possible.

375
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,590
Even if it's just
a prototype, you

376
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,830
don't have the full
rendering of the character.

377
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,110
If you have like a
little toy prototype

378
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,520
of being able to do this in a
very easy to use level editor,

379
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,810
I think you could probably
explore that space much more

380
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,430
efficiently than getting
it into the full game.

381
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,560
You know, maybe, maybe not.

382
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,280
It's just a thought.

383
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,780
 Sure.

384
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,590
Yeah.

385
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,040
 And just the
very last thing is,

386
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,020
you know, I think
that I would refine

387
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,000
your pitch a little bit
more, and don't start

388
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
with, it's a side scroller.

389
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,400
with, it's a side scroller.

390
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,120
 OK.

391
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,090
 You know, start with
something like, it's

392
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,230
a game about gravity.

393
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,320
 Yeah.

394
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,740
 You know.

395
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,850
Or something like that
that right off the bat

396
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,990
is like, oh, OK, gravity.

397
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,610
Sounds kind of cool
and interesting.

398
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,810
And, you know,
eventually-- in fact,

399
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,160
it's not necessarily
a side scroller,

400
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,640
cause you're going up
and down, and, you know,

401
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,950
all different directions.

402
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,810
But it's a cool idea.

403
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,850
I love the visuals
in it right now.

404
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,470
 Thank you.

405
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:47,640
 Sure.

406
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:47,810
 Yeah.

407
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,310
Thanks.
