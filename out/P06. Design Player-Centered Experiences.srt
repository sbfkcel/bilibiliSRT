3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,470
 One thing the game
designers really should know

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,960
is that, you know,
it's about the player.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,790
You know, it's a
player-centered experience.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,380
And the player is the one
driving that experience.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,670
You know, it's the difference
between being on a roller

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,460
coaster and being in a car,
behind the steering wheel.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,960
Now that player, because they're
holding the steering wheel,

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,540
they're responsible
for where they go.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,000
They have choice they
have decisions to make.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,910
They have choice they
have decisions to make.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,430
And because of that,
they take ownership.

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,910
And that totally changes their
relationship to whatever it is.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,660
You know, the fact
that they were the ones

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,500
to steer left or right, and
because it went off the cliff,

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,720
it was their fault, or
because they, you know,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,430
won the lottery, they
did it because they

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,640
picked those numbers.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,550
So I think that that's the
first and foremost thing,

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,670
is that when somebody feels
like they're in control

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,620
of a process, they own it.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,000
And it now has a fundamentally
more personal connection

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,360
And it now has a fundamentally
more personal connection

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,850
to them than something
that's one size

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,720

get on it, hope you enjoy it.

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,240
Flow is kind of a state that
the player can get into.

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,060
And I think of it as
basically something

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,640
that's right at the
limit of your abilities.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,830
It's pushing you mentally.

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,520
But it's not too
easy, not too hard.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,090
If it's too hard, it seems
random, it seems arbitrary,

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,000
it's frustrating.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,340
it's frustrating.

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,900
If it's too easy, it's
predictable, it's boring.

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,390
Flow is putting you right on
that edge of your abilities,

39
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,820
and really testing them.

40
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,300
I used to actually race cars.

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,890
And there was kind
of a rule of thumb

42
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,720
in racing that if you didn't
crash 10% of the time,

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,160
you weren't trying hard enough.

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,710
You need to design the
game such that failure is

45
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,260
interesting and understandable,
so that go back and say, aha,

46
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,590
now I need to avoid the turtles
or whatever it is in the game.

47
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,500
And then you kind of
build and grow that model.

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,630
But also you're
building your ability

49
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,510
to problem-solve and strategize.

50
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,000
Every player is can be
different, different abilities,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,060
Every player is can be
different, different abilities,

52
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,110
different skill sets.

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,170
In a lot of ways, you
want to make the game such

54
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,669
that the player is the one
adjusting the difficulty.

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,039
You know, they can choose to
go a little bit further, try

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,370
for this harder thing, or
stick with the easy stuff

57
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,660
until they're more comfortable.

58
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,780
So in some sense, a lot of it
can be kind of player-paced.

59
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
There are more
advanced systems that

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,570
are called DDA, or Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment,

61
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,150
where the computer,
behind the scenes,

62
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,410
is kind of watching
with the player's doing.

63
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,280
And if they're failing
too much, the computer

64
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
can actually lower
the difficulty level,

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
or increase it, you
know, if they're not

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
being challenged enough.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,310
being challenged enough.

68
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,520
But in a lot of games, you
know, by giving the player

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,560
enough freedom but
also enticing them

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,140
to try for the hard
things-- you know,

71
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,510
if you try for
this harder thing,

72
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,960
you might get this
bigger reward.

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,690
So at that point, the player can
kind of choose their own level,

74
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,240
and put themself
in the flow state.

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,210
There was a great story I heard.

84
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,940
It was an art teacher
in an art class--

85
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,710
it was actually a pottery class.

86
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,300
And at the beginning
of this class,

87
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,700
the beginning of the year,
he did divided the class

88
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,960
into two halves.

89
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,690
And the first half he
said, OK, your final grade

90
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,790
is going to be based upon
one pot that you make.

91
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,120
I want you to make the best
pot you could possibly make,

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,260
and your grade is going
to be based upon that.

93
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,150
The other half of the class,
he said, OK, your grade

94
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,800
is going to be based on
how many pots you make.

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,050
I don't care how bad they are.

96
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,000
Just the more you make,
the better your grade.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,480
Just the more you make,
the better your grade.

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,900
At the end of the
year, of course,

99
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,850
it turns out that the
half of the class that

100
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,920
was building the
most pots were also

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
building the best ones by far.

102
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,690
They had built so many bad pots,
and had iterated so many times,

103
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,080
they learned very rapidly.

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,570
And by the end of
the class, they

105
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,940
were building
these amazing pots.

106
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,240
Whereas the other half that
was spending all their time

107
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,470
thinking about one pot that
they were going to build,

108
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,100
you know, never got anywhere.

109
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,680
So it was the failure that
accelerated their learning

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,220
on the other half.

111
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,800
You know, and when
players play games,

112
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,000
again, they are failing
most of the time.

in the player.

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,740
And it's important that we
ramp that model up smoothly

and gradually for the player.

You don't want to pile all
this complexity on them right

128

It's overwhelming.

129
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,600
You should actually present
them a simpler model.

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,700
They can start building,
from that simple model,

131

layers and layers of complexity
onto it in their head

in some sense, is

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,860
responsible for ramping that
model in the player's head.

138
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,420
Now, when you're playing
an interactive experience,

139
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,000
you're actually going
through this set

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,590
of kind of nested loops
of success and failure.

141
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,050
When you first
start playing Mario,

142
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,700
you start mashing the
buttons, and you find out

143
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,680
that that button makes
him jump, this control

144
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,350
makes him move side to side.

145
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,700
About 10 seconds for you
to kind of figure that out.

146
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,160
So there's that
kind of 10 seconds,

147
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,320
I don't know how to control
Mario, then I succeed,

148
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,580
and finally know
how to control him,

149
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,000
which brings me kind of to
the next level of interaction,

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,950
which brings me kind of to
the next level of interaction,

151
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,230

155
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,210
I learn from that.

156
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,260
And then you go from kind of a
very tactical, very granular,

157
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,590
to longer and longer loops
of success and failure.

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,970
And the failure actually
is something that--

161
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,760
most people are spending
most of their time

162
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,210
in a game failing,
really, at different ways

163
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,350
and different loops here.

164
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,790
And it's not that you
don't want the player

165
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,390
to encounter
failure, but you want

166
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,900
them to understand
the failure, and build

167
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,000
a model around that failure
so that next time they

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,030
a model around that failure
so that next time they

169
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,600
will succeed.

170
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,210
That's part of the
motivation, is now

171
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,140
I understand that that's
good and that's bad.

172
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,510
Next time I will not
get stuck by that.

173
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,390
Let me show you an example of
that on the whiteboard here.

174
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,710
 

175
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,300
In a game like "The
Sims," you know,

176
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,040
basically you have
little characters

177
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,600
that you're controlling here.

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,750
And initially, you need to
understand first of all,

179
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,130
just how to make them move,
and walk around, and interact

180
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,460
with things, you know.

181
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,000
So in some sense, that's kind
of like the very first game loop

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,040
So in some sense, that's kind
of like the very first game loop

183
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,530
we're dealing with here.

184
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,290
On one side of that,
you know, is failure.

185
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,940
And you know, this
is me not being

186
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,370
able to control my character.

187
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,490
And once I've learned how
to make them walk around,

188
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,110
interact with things, you
know, then I've succeeded.

189
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,710
And this is, you know, this
is called interaction loop,

190
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,440
you know.

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,180
After that, you know, I
start dealing with-- they

192
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
have these little needs.

193
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,260
They get hungry, they get
tired, they want social,

194
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,490
they want entertainment.

195
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,810
And those things fail.

196
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,000
So right off the bat, you
know, they're sitting there,

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,270
So right off the bat, you
know, they're sitting there,

198
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,700
and they're crashing on
energy, they're bored,

199
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,440
they're basically unhappy.

200
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,750
And so the next level loop
I really have to kind of do

201
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,700
is figure out how to
bring that happiness up.

202
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,150
So that's kind of
like the happy loop.

203
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,860
And that's a little
bit longer timescale.

204
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,620
You know, that takes several
minutes within The Sims.

205
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,990
And again, you
know, there's kind

206
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,790
of a success side to that and
a failure side to that loop.

207
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,120
Now there are also things,
you know, within these loops.

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,020
And we kind of keep going.

209
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,580
You know, the next
one might be economic.

210
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,910
At some point, they want to
start improving their house,

211
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,750
getting a job, getting
skills, you know.

212
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,000
So let's call that Jobs.

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
So let's call that Jobs.

214
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,240
You know, and that's an
even longer loop here.

215
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,490
But a lot of games like "The
Sims," or creative games,

216
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,920
you know, also
involve, basically,

217
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,880
orthogonal creativity.

218
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,250
You know, so in addition to
playing the game, in addition

219
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,860
to kind of dealing with
all these game loops,

220
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,410
I'm doing this weird stuff,
like telling a story with this,

221
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,060
or trying to
replicate my family,

222
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,580
or just exploring, seeing, I
wonder if my Sim could do that.

223
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,080
And so there are
probably, you know,

224
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,200
other loops that are in a
different dimension, really,

225
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,390
than this-- kind of
more like there--

226
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,000
that don't have a lot
to do with me succeeding

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,460
that don't have a lot
to do with me succeeding

228
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,920
on the overall
game's success curve,

229
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,930
but have more to do with
the player exploring

230
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,270
their own creativity,
their own expressiveness.

231
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,830
And some players, you know,
get totally invested in this,

232
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,180
and eventually start
ignoring that, you know.

233
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,490
But most games have some version
of these different loops,

234
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:17,990
you know.

235
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,860
And it might be learn to shoot,
then learn to unlock the door,

236
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,740
then learn to defeat the
evil boss at the end.

237
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,480
You know, this is
pretty much, you know,

238
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,450
the same graph of the player
building up this mental model.

239
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,000
So the player's,
you know, model--

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,370
So the player's,
you know, model--

241
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,760
the player's up here,
controlling this game.

242
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,150
And you know, in their head,
you know, they're basically

243
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,799
building this mental model--

244
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,309
you know, kind of
one layer at a time--

245
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,300
of your game.

246
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,460
And those layers of
that model are very much

247
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,160
aligned to these
interaction layers.

248

[MUSIC PLAYING]

249
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,550
 

250
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,350
As players are going
through these loops,

251
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,000
and slowly building
this model, you know,

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,500
and slowly building
this model, you know,

253
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,660
again, really it's that
most of what they're going

254
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,250
to experience is failure--

255
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,860
again, and again, and again--
which doesn't sound very fun.

256
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,710
But it's the game designer's
job to present that in a way

257
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,110
that's entertaining,
and informative,

258
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,560
and that it's not frustrating.

259
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,980
I don't want to
be failing on, you

260
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,150
know, exactly the
same thing over,

261
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,790
and over, and over, especially
when I know why I'm failing.

262
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,750
Some games-- you know,
some platform games, you

263
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,060
have to time it exactly
right, and it's really hard.

264
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,120
And those can kind of get
very frustrating, you know,

265
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,660
when you know that you
have to acquire the skill,

266
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,000
and you can't quite acquire it.

267
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So you're not
failing because you

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,100
So you're not
failing because you

269
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,540
don't know what you need to do.

270
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,800
It's just that it's
so hard for you

271
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,970
to kind of get into that
skill set, that sweet spot,

272
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,210
for some people it
becomes frustrating.

273
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,630
So when somebody
fails in a game,

274
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,000
you want it to be
understandable,

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,960
you want to be something
that they can overcome

276
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,750
once they understand it.

277
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,710
Also, again, humor
can be a great tool

278
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,030
to alleviate the frustration.

279
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,770
You know, when somebody fills
in a certain very basic thing

280
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,850
in a game, sometimes
you want to actually

281
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,540
have a variety of failure
states that become humorous.

282
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,000
So at least when
they're failing again,

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,160
So at least when
they're failing again,

284
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,030
and again, and again, it's not
exactly the same repetition

285
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,610
over and over.

286
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,690
You know, you might just
have different animations

287
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,590
for the same failure.

288
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,920
But again, the humor, I think,
can be a great tool here.

289
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,930
But if presented
right, you know,

290
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,610
players get very
motivated, when they

291
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,870
understand why they failed, to
then go back and do it again.

293

294
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,060
The kind of games
I tend to make tend

295
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,070
to be more system-level games.

296
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,000
And you know, they
frequently-- like, you know,

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,070
And you know, they
frequently-- like, you know,

298
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,110
"Sim City" or "The Sims"
involve you constructing

299
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,270
something that,
you know, gets more

300
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,940
and more elaborate over time.

301
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,270
As you achieve success, and
your city grows, or your Sims,

302
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,510
you know, get more
stuff in their house,

303
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,130
you're adding more
complexity to their world.

304
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,340
You know, in "The Sims,"
there's kind of this promise

305
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,160
that, oh, you buy this
crap for your Sims,

306
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
and it'll make them happy.

307
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,570
Get them a big-screen TV
here, or a better bed there.

308
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,950
But in some sense,
as you acquire

309
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,870
more and more of these items,
they become time bombs.

310
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,000
Each one of these things
has a failure state,

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,550
Each one of these things
has a failure state,

312
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,560
or some maintenance
requirement, or whatever.

313
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,930
So as you fill your house with
all this junk, what you're

314
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,890
really doing is these
things are potential time

315
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,600
sinks down the road, which
add complexity to their world,

316
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,640
and make it much more
difficult to play the game.

317
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,390
Same with "Sim City," you
know, first you're just,

318
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,280
you know, zoning a few
little plots of land,

319
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,060
and building a few roads.

320
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,800
And you see a few things pop
up, and pretty soon, they

321
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,370
need power.

322
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,390
OK, you give them power.

323
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,220
Now they need water,
now they want a school,

324
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,930
now they want a
hospital, now-- you know.

325
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,380
And so as they make
progress in the game,

326
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,910
and the system is growing, the
complexity is growing as well.

327
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,000
And so it's a very natural,
smooth ramp in complexity.

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
And so it's a very natural,
smooth ramp in complexity.

329
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,960
It's not like, OK, you
finished level 1, now here's

330
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,390
level 2, where we're
adding two more rules.

331
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,940
It's, you know, very smoothly
based upon-- and in some sense,

332
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,120
the player is asking for it.

333
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
You know, as a player,
you know, gets their city

334
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,640
to that size, of course
they need a hospital now.

335
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,480
So it totally fits, and it
didn't feel arbitrary either.

336
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,450
It kind of feels
natural in that way.

339
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,000
It's not just how much
difficulty is in the path,

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,900
It's not just how much
difficulty is in the path,

341
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,640
but also how many
paths are there.

342
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,770
You know, I think that the
really interesting games

343
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,540
are ones that allow
different paths

344
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,550
towards some kind of success.

345
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,920
And in particular,
the kind of games I do

346
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,940
don't even make
success that explicit.

347
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,700
You know, in "The
Sims," you can decide

348
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,590
you want them to have a good
job, or want them to be happy.

349
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,670
Same in "Sim City,"
you can want,

350
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,380
you know, the biggest
city you can build,

351
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,400
or the happiest residents,
or the least crime.

352
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,880
So in some sense, the player
is choosing the goal state.

353
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,260
Now each one of
these goal states

354
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,870
is going to have kind of a
different path of difficulty.

355
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,000
And so for me it's
more about, there's

356
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,790
And so for me it's
more about, there's

357
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,120
a landscape here of paths
that the player can take,

358
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,170
and each one has
different peaks.

359
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,500
But none of these have a
cliff, where you hit the cliff,

360
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,080
and all of a sudden, you know,
now it's really hard to get up.

361
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,140
You know, they all have kind of
different motivations of slope

362
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,720
up those achievement peaks.

363
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,460
And that's something that, you
know, again, it's really hard.

364
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,880
It's an emergent
property, so it's

365
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,150
very hard to just say, OK,
here's how we code that.

366
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,550
A lot of times, players will
find exploits around it.

367
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,000
Or it'll turn out
that, you know, again,

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,320
Or it'll turn out
that, you know, again,

369
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,270
pressing the red button
is not that obvious.

370
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,300
So this is, again,
something we actually

371
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
will capture metrics on.

372
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,350
We will actually
have a lot of people,

373
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,580
as we start getting
more and more testers,

374
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,660
we're capturing metrics--

375
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,680
how long is somebody spinning
in that stage or this stage?

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,340
How many people are failing
on this point or that point?

377
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,660
And so that's stuff that you all
want to make fairly parametric,

378
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,890
that you can adjust fairly
granularly in testing.

You know, there's
just the advancement--

how far did I get in the game,
or there are special abilities

power-ups and stuff in a game.

It's just it gets, you

a little too obvious.

391
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,310
I think a lot of the really
interesting player rewards

392
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,520
are things that they think
they came up with himself,

393
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,860
or they discovered
this thing in the game.

394
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,480
And I think discovery
is a huge part of this,

395
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
is that if you leave areas of
the game that are maybe closed

you know, just open one
of these little gates

399
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,110
and let them see that, hey,
there's a lot of stuff hidden

400
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,790
in here if you look
a little bit deeper

401

or try a little bit harder.

You see things-- you know,
people playing "Grand Theft

manage to get on top of places

make a movie of it,

and it becomes kind of
a machinima of sorts.

409
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,640
I remember back in
"Sim City 2000," which

410
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,310
is a very old game,
we had, you know,

411
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,000
of course landscape,
train, rivers, you know.

train, rivers, you know.

But we actually programmed in
that, you know, once in a very,

were playing the game for 100

hours, it might
happen for, you know,

a few seconds in 100 hours--

417
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,230
we actually had this
little Loch Ness

Monster appear in the
water, pop his head out.

419

And there was kind of
rumors amongst the players

420
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,640
that, I think I saw a
monster in the water.

No, no, no, I've
never seen that.

Somebody, once, eventually
got a screenshot of it.

hard-to-achieve reward.

to do this, and capture it,

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,100
that it became--

430
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,640
actually a lot of
players were trying
