3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,100
 Well, thank you for going
through this entire course.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,590
And I hope that from
this point on you'll

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,910
go out into your field,
whatever that is, and use

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,270
these new tools in your
toolbox to do something maybe

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,040
a little bit more
outside your own box

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,740
and create things that
even surprise yourself.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,240
Really, more than
anything else, I'm

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,000
looking forward to seeing
the games that you'll create.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,689
looking forward to seeing
the games that you'll create.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,190
The generation
that's creating games

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,980
now has so many
opportunities, and the things

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,350
I'm seeing come out
right now are amazing.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,850
And I really want to sit back,
have a comfortable retirement,

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,370
and play these cool
games that I only right

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,950
now can imagine but I
know that one day you

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,240
will make as designers.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,040
The possibility space for
your next game is huge.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,000
So find something
you're passionate about

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,750
So find something
you're passionate about

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,100
and start exploring.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,460
 

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,280
Remember, look around you.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,350
Your next idea might be
lurking somewhere nearby.

28
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,480
Go out and catch it.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,620
 

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,110
I'll be here, anxiously
waiting, ready to play.
