WILL WRIGHT: Whenever I get
to the point where I decide,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,440
OK, I'm building
a game about this,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,840
I start imagining
how do I present

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,300
this idea to other people.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,280
What am I kind of imagining
the process to feel like,

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,110
the activities, the
agency I have in this?

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,420
I'm starting to actually
play that game in my own head

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,030
at a more and more
detailed level,

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,000
while at the same time trying
to imagine, OK, how do I offload

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,030
while at the same time trying
to imagine, OK, how do I offload

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,160
or download that play experience
into somebody else effectively?

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,040
And that becomes kind
of a part of the pitch.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,780
 

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,290
Whether you're trying to
communicate your design

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,710
vision to your team or to
executives or to your audience,

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,740
you need to kind of remember
why you want to do it.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,850
What got you excited?

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,700
What is the key thing that's
really motivating you?

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,000
And then you step
back and say, OK,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,680
And then you step
back and say, OK,

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,040
how can I recreate that
process in that person's head?

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,130
How can I make them
see or understand

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,760
or feel the way I feel
about this design direction?

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,510
And maybe it's not the
explicit, overt description

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,700
of what your game
is going to be.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,000
Maybe it's more a
getting into their head,

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,450
into the emotional
motivation that drives you.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,910
And maybe it's more
about the creativity

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,250
you'll have in this,
or the expressiveness,

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,000
or what it's going to feel
like, this nostalgic--

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,710
or what it's going to feel
like, this nostalgic--

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,540
go back to your childhood
playing this thing

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,500
that you used to play.

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,520
There might be a
lot of directions

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,570
you kind of take that.

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,180
But in some sense, like
game design itself,

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,710
you're hacking psychology.

40
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,290
You're trying to
imagine, what does it

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,830
take to make that person
feel the way I feel.

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,750
It's almost like
reverse empathy--

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,940
how do I push my feelings
into that person?

44
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,740
Interestingly, most of the hits
I've had-- the really big hits,

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,540
SimCity, The Sims--

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,000
were the ideas that I got
amazing amount of pushback

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,770
were the ideas that I got
amazing amount of pushback

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,600
from with almost everybody
I described it to initially.

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,830
And at some point, I actually
had to kind of reformulate

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,530
the way I was thinking about
it to then communicate it

51
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,180
effectively.

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,750
And I did.

53
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,100
You know, I kind of
thought, OK, what

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,410
is it about the way I was
talking about this thing that's

55
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,160
not hitting the mark
in their head the way

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,290
it hits in my head?

57
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,780
And eventually, I found
ways to actually communicate

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,060
what I was really
thinking, which

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,400
wasn't an explicit description
of the game design,

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,000
but more the feeling I was
going to have playing this game.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,980
but more the feeling I was
going to have playing this game.

62
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,040
And if I could now figure
out, OK, now how can I

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,270
make them imagine that feeling?

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,310
And what do I say to them
to imagine that feeling

65
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,500
that I would imagine
feeling playing this game?

66
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,210
So I took, like, one
step deeper, really.

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,990
Right off the bat,
as soon as you think,

70
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,240
oh, I have an idea for a
game, tell your friends.

71
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,020
See what they say.

72
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
Tell other people.

73
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,200
Tell people you meet.

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,000
And you can just observe and
learn from the result of what

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,810
And you can just observe and
learn from the result of what

76
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,470
they--

77
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,340
the questions they ask you,
what they seem interested in,

78
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,840
or they want to
know more about it,

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,740
or they want to talk
about something else.

80
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,120
You learn very rapidly.

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,980
And then when it comes
to the point of now

82
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,710
you're pitching the team
members or executives,

83
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,740
you will have refined that idea
quite a bit up to that point

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,340
already.

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,810
You don't want to wait until
you're actually pitching it

86
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,950
to somebody who matters.

87
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,290
Typically, we try to go for
what's called the elevator

88
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,290
pitch, eventually.

89
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,290
Initially, when I work
on a game, I'll sit there

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,500
and I'll describe
for 10 minutes,

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,690
oh, well, there's a game
where you do this, that,

92
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,730
and the other, and it works
like that, duh duh duh duh duh.

93
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,000
But eventually, you want to get
that down to, like, one minute

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,310
But eventually, you want to get
that down to, like, one minute

95
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,040
or 30 seconds.

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,940
There's no easy formula
for that at all.

97
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,080
I think repetition, or trying
a hundred different things is

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
probably the most
effective thing I found.

99
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,440
One thing that we would
do on the larger games,

100
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,020
we would go to a
trade show like E3.

101
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,320
And a lot of times,
we would be talking

102
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,600
about a game before
release, pretty early on,

103
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,790
to certain press members.

104
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,000
A lot of times I would be in
there giving a description

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,780
A lot of times I would be in
there giving a description

106
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,240
to interviewers, but
it would be every five

107
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,950
minutes a different
interviewer comes in.

108
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,340
And then another one comes
in, another one comes in,

109
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,250
another one comes in.

110
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,330
So that actually became a
great opportunity for me

111
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,580
to figure out how
to refine the pitch.

112
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,350
I would try a pitch
with this person.

113
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,100
I would notice them
getting kind of bored,

114
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,589
looking at their thing during
that part of the pitch.

115
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,200
They'd get wide-eyed
and look at me

116
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,079
attentively during
another part of the pitch.

117
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,780
So the next person
that came in the room,

118
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,070
I would expand on those
areas, prune the other ones,

119
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,990
try it on that person.

120
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,000
So I was actually iteratively
evolving the pitch rapidly

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,870
So I was actually iteratively
evolving the pitch rapidly

122
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,520
over the course of one day.

123
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,850
And that, I found,
actually-- we would also

124
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,500
across team members--
other designers

125
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,840
or team members who
might be there talking

126
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,880
to people about it.

127
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,170
And they would come back to
me and say, oh, they really

128
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,160
got interested when
they heard this part,

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,030
but they didn't seem to
care about that part.

130
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,510
So we'd actually compare notes,
and we'd actually together,

131
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,400
as a team, try to
refine that pitch.

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,950
OK, let's talk more about
this, lean into that,

133
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,000
lean away from there.

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,060
So the pitch is
something that I think

135
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,180
will be evolving over time.

136
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,000
Initially, you're going
to come up with this idea,

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,260
Initially, you're going
to come up with this idea,

138
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,380
and you might tell somebody
at your company or a friend

139
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,850
or whatever, and that's going
to be the very first time.

140
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,660
And it's going to be horrible.

141
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,040
I mean, you're just not
going to convey it very well.

142
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,000
And maybe the idea in
your head isn't very well

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,790
formulated, either.

144
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,500
Maybe you just have a very
fuzzy idea of the kind of game

145
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,290
you're thinking of.

146
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,370
So in your head as well,
you are refining that model

147
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,470
and trying to make that
thing more and more fun.

148
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,860
As you interact and tell more
and more people about it,

149
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,110
I think you will naturally
evolve it, naturally

150
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,000
discover the most effective
way to communicate it.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,720
discover the most effective
way to communicate it.

152
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,210
And so I'd say
repetition is probably

153
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,200
the best rule of thumb.

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,940
And as you're
building that team,

160
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,480
one of the very first things--

161
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
skills-- that you
really have to have

162
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
is the ability to communicate
your design to your team.

163
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,000
And continually, even when
you're refining your idea

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,900
And continually, even when
you're refining your idea

165
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,240
or changing it, you need to make
sure the team is aware of that.

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,840
And it's more understanding
the direction you're

167
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,640
going, not the destination.

168
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,240
And over time, as they come to
you with, should we do A or B?

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
And you start saying,
B, B, B, they'll

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,550
start learning to
predict your decisions.

171
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,140
And they'll start making more
and more of those decisions.

172
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,060
If they're unclear,
they'll still come to you.

173
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,990
So in some sense, you're
educating your entire team

174
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,640
ongoingly about
what the design is

175
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,410
and where it's going to head.

176
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,000
This is a more granular
version of the same process

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,930
This is a more granular
version of the same process

178
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,550
you're going to use
to pitch your idea.

179
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,180
When you go out to
other people and try

180
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,300
to sell them on the idea,
to fund it or whatever,

181
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,130
you're going to basically
try to communicate

182
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,530
very clearly to them what's
in your head, what you're

183
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,910
imagining.

184
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,750
When I did The Sims, it
was a big challenge for me.

185
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,690
And I was-- within my own
company was rejected many

186
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,640
times, because I was describing
this game-- first of all,

187
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,370
I'd never--

188
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,370
after the product was
about halfway done,

189
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,790
I never once called
it this again,

190
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,290
but I used to call it Dollhouse.

191
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,970
That was the initial
name for the game.

192
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,000
And I found that it
was such a loaded term

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,950
And I found that it
was such a loaded term

194
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,920
that any male gamer, they
hear a game called Dollhouse,

195
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,460
they're not going
to play that game.

196
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,850
So that was one thing I learned.

197
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,210
Also, as I pitched this
to executives and stuff,

198
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,680
I was talking about
this cool game

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,100
where you're
managing these people

200
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,020
and they have limited
time and all this stuff.

201
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,180
But what they were
hearing was, here's

202
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,710
a game where you
take out the trash

203
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,820
and load the dishwasher, which
didn't sound very aspirational.

204
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,640
So I found that I had
to kind of rethink

205
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,490
the way I was presenting
the whole concept

206
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,000
and idea to somebody--

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,300
and idea to somebody--

208
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,470
that no, it's little people.

209
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,300
You can mess with them, and they
live lives in your computer,

210
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,600
and it's up to you
to make them happy.

211
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,290
That was much more interesting,
rich kind of metaphor

212
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,130
for them to wrap
their heads around.

213
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,310
So you're not just
learning to pitch

214
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,770
to your design team or
your production team,

215
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,320
but also to people outside
within your company,

216
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,090
and then eventually
to the end consumer.

217
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,090
Eventually, you're going
to put an ad on the web

218
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,170
or in a box or whatever.

219
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,210
But you're going to have
to clearly and concisely

220
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,500
communicate to somebody
what this game is,

221
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,540
why they want to play it.

222
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,000
Because they're going to
start playing it in their head

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Because they're going to
start playing it in their head

224
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,270
as soon as they hear about it.

225
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,650
Before they even see
the game, as soon

226
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,240
as somebody describes it, oh,
you should check out this game,

227
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,080
it's about X, Y, and Z, they're
going to start imagining, OK,

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
that sounds kind of fun.

229
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,350
And they're actually playing
the game, a very simple version

230
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,890
of the game that they're
imagining in their head.

231
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,820
And that game has to be fun.

232
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
That's the first game
you're actually designing,

233
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,400
is the pitch.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

235
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,500
 

236
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,030
If you're pitching to your team
members, designers, whatnot,

237
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,430
they want to know--

238
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,000
they're going to want
to hear something that's

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,350
they're going to want
to hear something that's

240
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,840
unique and interesting they're
going to be proud to build,

241
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,799
and something that's
buildable, because they're

242
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,700
going to be responsible for
actually having to build it,

243
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,500
and something that sounds
creatively challenging.

244
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,789
That's what they're looking for.

245
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,040
And so you have to pitch--

246
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,410
here's something that's going
to be really cool to build,

247
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,910
unique, people are going to
love it, and we can make it.

248
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,230
When you're pitching
to the executives--

249
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,770
it depends on the company, how
big it is and all this stuff--

250
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,000
but basically, whatever
the big hit was last year,

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,760
but basically, whatever
the big hit was last year,

252
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,070
it's like that but better.

253
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,110
That's kind of the cliche.

254
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,190
Obviously, the most successful
genre in any format,

255
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,540
almost, is the sequel.

256
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,050
So if it's a
sequel, they're just

257
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,260
going to want to know that
you're going to execute it

258
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,140
well and not screw it up.

259
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,060
If it's an original
thing, they're

260
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,460
going to basically be
measuring against that.

261
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,980
Should I invest in
this original thing

262
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,800
or put more money
into the next version

263
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,560
of this popular franchise?

264
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,000
And at that point,
a lot of it's just

265
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
And at that point,
a lot of it's just

266
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,270
going to be based upon
your track record.

267
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,520
Now, as you're pitching
to an audience, of course,

268
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,590
now you're kind of
saying, try my game out.

269
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,780
Or in journalists is a
whole different thing--

270
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,400
pitching to a
journalist, they're

271
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,220
going to want to write an
interesting story, something

272
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,680
where they can actually exhibit
a fair amount of creativity

273
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,440
in their review or
their writing of it.

274
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,750
So if you give them
something where they can also

275
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,260
take a creative spin
in their writing,

276
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,760
that sounds more
attractive to them.

277
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,610
There's actually a
pretty big distinction,

278
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,000
I think, between
what I call the game

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,150
I think, between
what I call the game

280
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,550
journalists and general media.

281
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,300
When you're pitching
to a game journalist,

282
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,520
they're going to be very jaded.

283
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,560
Everybody's coming
to them saying,

284
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,660
oh, I'm going to
build the next big hit

285
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,910
and it's going to be
duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

286
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,040
And they're going to want
to hear something that,

287
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,780
to them, actually sounds
creative, unique, something

288
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,330
that really is fresh
within the game industry,

289
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,790
because they hear all these
ideas within the game industry.

290
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,540
But also they want to believe
that whoever is pitching

291
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,890
them can actually execute this.

292
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,510
A lot of people can
give a great pitch,

293
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,000
but they can never
build a product.

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,020
but they can never
build a product.

295
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,810
General media, I think it's
a little bit different story.

296
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,350
For them, it's going
to be more like,

297
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,030
why does my audience care?

298
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,780
You know, it's a game.

299
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,380
So there almost has
to be a hook into them

300
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,210
where, oh, people
that don't even

301
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,600
play games will be interested
in this because of x, y, and z.

302
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,710
Maybe it's topical,
or maybe it's

303
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,110
involving some new technology
or something, whatever it is.

304
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,000
But they almost
need another hook

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,300
to understand why their
wider audience is also

306
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,000
going to tune into this
thing that they kind of think

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,850
going to tune into this
thing that they kind of think

308
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,300
of as a niche product.

309
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,810
So I think you need to kind
of understand the motivations

310
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,200
of each of these groups.

developed, which I'm not sure

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,530
is even that successful, is
trying to get people back

315
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,520
to the original topic.

316
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,770
You know, here's why
I think ants are cool.

317
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,920
Here's why I think it's cool
to construct little buildings

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,000
and put little people in them.

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,170
and put little people in them.

320

Here's why I think
evolution is cool.

321
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,570
So I try to usually start
with the topic, why I

322
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,820
think I got motivated in that.

323
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,440
And then kind of back
into-- and here's

324
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,670
a game where you get to
make this and do that.

325
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,660
And I found that the
more we can reference

326
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,240
the player in the
pitch, generally

327
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,650
the better the pitch went.

328
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,540
It's not like, here's a world in
which this happens, but here's

329
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,000
a world in which
you are the mayor,

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,530
and you get to decide
where to put the roads,

331
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,510
and you get to do this,
that, and the other.

332
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,340
So if you start to say,
these are the things

333
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,000
that you can do in
the game and make

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,890
that you can do in
the game and make

335
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,520
that sound interesting,
that kind of reverses

336
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,060
the whole thing--
rather than, here's

337
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,350
this thing I want to sell you.

340
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,680
One of the fundamental
questions that you're probably

341
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,250
going to get, especially if
the pitch is very unrefined,

342
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,760
is why is that going to be fun?

343
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,890
Which is a hard
question to answer,

344
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,050
because if your
pitch really conveyed

345
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,880
what it needed to
convey, they wouldn't

346
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,000
be asking that question.

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,940
be asking that question.

348
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,080
It would already be fun
in their imagination.

349
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,580
They wouldn't ask
you that question.

350
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,120
So that really indicates
a key part of your pitch,

351
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,000
you're missing.

352
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,080
People will try to triangulate
your idea against other games,

353
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,720
and they'll say, oh, is
it kind of like this game

354
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,070
but a little bit of that?

355
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,770
Or this game that's turn-based
instead of real-time?

356
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,350
In their mind, they're
kind of looking

357
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,020
at the landscape of all
the games they know about

358
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,200
and trying to figure out where
yours falls into that landscape

359
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
by finding landmarks nearby,
saying it's somewhere

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,420
by finding landmarks nearby,
saying it's somewhere

361
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,370
between there and there.

362
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,460
And that's going
to be very common.

363
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,540
And if your game is not
in that landscape at all--

364
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,660
if it's an outlier over here--

365
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,740
that's both good and bad.

366
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,910
It's hard for them
to triangulate,

367
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,480
because they've never
seen anything like that.

368
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,610
But on the other
hand, it could feel

369
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,200
fresh if you could
pitch it the right way.

370
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,760
You can almost kind
of take the outliers

371
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,720
in that direction, say,
oh, it's kind of like this,

372
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
but we took it in a
totally different direction

373
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,330
that nobody's ever done before.

374
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,440
Now, if it's understandable
and you can basically,

375
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,820
again, download that it's
totally different in this way--

376
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,000
so they can actually
start imagining why

that's good, why that's fun--

379
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,650

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,500
A lot of startup
pitches, somebody says,

383
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,650
OK, here's the cool new
trend that's just popped up

384
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,710
in social media or in
platforms or whatever it is,

385
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,630
and we're going
to be right on it.

386
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,400
We're going to be
riding that wave.

387
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,440
And so I think that the
people that are really

388
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,140
involved in these industries,
they're kind of jaded.

389
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,000
They know that every
pitch coming this month

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
They know that every
pitch coming this month

391
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,790
is going to involve
Facebook or this or that,

392
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,040
or whatever the hot thing
of the month is going to be.

393
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,040
So I think that you have to be
a little bit careful about that

394
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,020
in particular.

395
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,730
I think you need to feel
like your thing, whatever

396
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,370
it is, is standing on its
own legs, on its own merits,

397
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,110
and it's not just
going to be successful

398
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,290
because it's part of this trend
that's happening this month.

399
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,750
There's another actually really
important part to, I think,

400
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,510
pitching, which is
that recognizing

401
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,530
when you've sold your idea.

402
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't continue and unsell it.

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,250
Don't continue and unsell it.

404
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,750
A lot of times, if
you give somebody

405
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,140
a fairly brief
explanation of your idea,

406
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,620
leave a lot of blanks in there.

407
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,120
The person you're pitching to
will generally fill the blanks

408
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,490
in in your favor.

409
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,360
This is the way I would
fill in those blanks,

410
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,780
so you're probably going to
do it the way I would want to.

411
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,150
And so if you
leave those blanks,

412
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,360
they're going to imagine
those filled in the way they

413
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
would want to fill them in.

414
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,730
If you keep going
with your pitch

415
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,150
and start filling in those
blanks in a different direction

416
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,500
that they don't like, you
have now unsold the idea

417
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,310
after you just sold it to them.

418
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,000
So I think it's very important
to realize when to stop.

422
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,790
The one thing that I think
is the biggest mistake

423
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,570
that I see is when
people lead with genre.

424
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,030
The first thing
they say is, I want

425
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,310
to build a first-person
shooter that

426
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,410
does duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

427
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,420
To me, as soon as I
hear genre, in my mind

428
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,220
they've already basically
compartmentalized

429
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,630
how far they're going to go.

430
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,000
They're not even
willing to think of it

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,250
They're not even
willing to think of it

432
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,380
outside of that genre or
an expansion of the genre,

433
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,450
but they've already put
themselves in a box--

434
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,840
a fairly limited box that's
been very thoroughly explored.

435
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,670
Now, it's OK if it's a
first-person shooter.

436
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,660
That's fine.

437
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,030
But maybe it's a first-person
shooter with relationships

438
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,320
and social networks,
and there might be

439
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,780
a lot of other things involved.

440
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,920
But when they say first-person
shooter, in my mind

441
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,380
I'm automatically putting it
in the very limited little box

442
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,760
of experience.

443
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,790
I think other ones is people
tend to be too verbose.

444
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,690
They tend to add way too
many details way too early.

445
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,000
There was that saying
about, your garden

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,460
There was that saying
about, your garden

447
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,400
is not complete until there's
nothing else you can remove.

448
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,000
I think for your pitch, you want
to remove every possible word

449
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,160
that is unnecessary,
and refine it down

450
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,420
to that level of conciseness.

451
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,010
And those are, I think, the
two most common mistakes

452
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,990
I hear when people give pitches.

453
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,430
The third probably comes
more down to energy,

454
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,430
that if the person
giving you the pitch

455
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,300
doesn't really feel
excited about it,

456
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,430
and it's more like, oh,
yeah, I got this game idea,

457
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,000
it's going to be,
yeah, you know--

it's going to be,
yeah, you know--

459
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,190
how can they expect me
to be excited about it?

460
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,860
But if somebody comes up to
me with a very concise idea,

461
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,070
they lead with the topic or
what's cool about it to them,

462
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,920
they don't say
anything unnecessary,
