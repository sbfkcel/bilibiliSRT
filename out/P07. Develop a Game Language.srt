00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,120
WILL WRIGHT: As a
designer, you're

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
putting a player into
this world of yours,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,300
and through their interactions
and freedom and agency that you

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,700
give them in your
world, you're actually

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,410
kind of developing a
language with the player.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,410
The players are basically
learning this language

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,780
in playing the game,
and it's the designer

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,000
that's creating the world that
is defined by that language.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,030
that's creating the world that
is defined by that language.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,550
There's an interesting
aspect to games, which is--

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,370
and this idea was way
before computer games--

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,180
of the magic circle.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,600
And this is the idea,
especially in social games,

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,310
that you have kids
come together and they

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,500
decide they're going to
play whatever, hopscotch,

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,380
and the players of the
game are basically now

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,570
within this thing we
call the magic circle.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,280
They are bound by the
rules of that game.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,160
Other people might be outside
observing, watching the game,

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,720
and they're not in that circle.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
In some sense, you're kind of
building a temporary community

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
In some sense, you're kind of
building a temporary community

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,239
with the players within
that game and they're all

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,970
basically bound by the game
rules and living in that world

27
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,410
together.

28
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,290
This is, in some sense, one
of the fundamental parts

29
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,910
of game language.

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,230
Are you playing or not?

31
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,770
Who's playing in
that game right now?

32
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:22,720
 

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,760
As a language within
games, I think

34
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,170
that we do have the
same types of grammar

35
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,000
that real language has.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,480
that real language has.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,900
In the world,
things are basically

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,390
kind of nouns, verbs,
and adjectives.

39
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,120
I might go out the door to
see this dog barking at me.

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,300
The dog is basically the
noun, it's the thing.

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,630
The verb might be bite.

42
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm afraid he's
going to bite me.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,870
Adjective is mad.

44
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,030
He's a mad dog,
he's barking at me.

45
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,100
Based upon that, I will
you decide me run fast away

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,060
from the dog, whatever.

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,380
That you can almost interpret
everything in the world

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,240
according to these
parts of speech.

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,280
In a game, players will
encounter the same thing.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,030
What is that?

51
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,870
What can it do?

52
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,000
What does my agency allow
me to do against it?

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,550
What does my agency allow
me to do against it?

54
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,100
And so that's the
kind of language

55
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,510
that the players need to learn
in your game very rapidly

56
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,510
and feel very comfortable
and almost transparent

57
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,830
in learning that.

58
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,830
When you're designing what
the language of your game is--

59
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,410
the nouns, verbs, adjectives--

60
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,110
of course, it depends entirely
on the setting in which you're

61
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,300
putting a single player into.

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,730
You can describe a setting
or show a player a screen

63
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,360
and tell them, what would you
imagine wanting to do here?

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,900
I think that's a
good starting point.

65
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,650
As a player, what are the things
I think I should be able to do?

66
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,000
What things occur to
me right off the bat?

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,090
What things occur to
me right off the bat?

68
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,070
And you can actually
just talk to people

69
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,950
and show them the setting
and see what they say,

70
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,650
see what the most
common answers are.

71
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,420
As they move through
your space, however

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,840
that space is displayed,
things will occur to them.

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
I wish I could do that.

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,490
Can I move this?

75
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,260
Can I pick that up?

76
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,880
Can I put something there?

77
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,160
And so for a lot people,
it's just going to be--

78
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,570
once they immerse themselves
in this little world,

79
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,030
they're going to
be a set of things

80
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,090
that they would like to try.

81
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,550
And if you give
then a goals state,

82
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,000
say okay, try to do this, it's
going to be much more specific.

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,280
say okay, try to do this, it's
going to be much more specific.

84
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,790
Oh, okay.

85
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, in that case, can I
move, can I open that door,

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,740
do I need a key?

87
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,160
That's where you're
going to start

88
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,570
deciding how much
freedom or agency

89
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,280
does the player
have in this world?

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,650
What are the things in which
they're going to manipulate?

91
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,730
And what kind of
interface are we

92
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,150
going to basically
give the player

93
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,000
so they do that very naturally?

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,600
And you also need to present
these things in the world such

95
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,310
that it's fairly obvious
that these are nouns--

96
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,700
you can manipulate-- or
part of the game world, part

97
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,060
of the game actions.

98
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,530
And I think that you're
informing the player

99
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,000
about these things in a
lot of different ways.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,490
about these things in a
lot of different ways.

101
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,070
Sometimes it's
just the art style.

102
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,110
These things stand out a little
bit against the background

103
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,070
and so they're important.

104
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,990
A lot of times you'll
have like the background

105
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,330
trees and landscape is
a little more muted,

106
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,270
whereas the foreground things
like maybe tanks and Jeeps

107
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,540
are more saturated in color.

108
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,990
So it could just be artistic.

109
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,390
It could be the way you
highlight these things,

110
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,720
the way they intimate.

111
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,470
So in some sense,
you're kind of informing

112
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,570
what are the important nouns
in a scene by the visuals.

113
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,470
And the verbs are going
to be very dependent

114
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,000
upon the interface and the
point of view of the game,

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,680
upon the interface and the
point of view of the game,

116
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,460
whether it's first person,
third person, whatever.

117
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,190
For instance, I show
somebody a train

118
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,570
and say, okay, you're going
to build a city here, and ask

119
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,990
them, what's the very first
thing that would occur to you?

120
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,810
And people might say roads
or houses or whatever it is.

121
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,490
But they'll start telling you
verbs they wouldn't expect

122
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,140
to play with in this place set.

123
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,260
If it's a first person
game and they're

124
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,000
trying to escape
something, they're

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,270
going to be looking for doors,
keys, a whole set of things

126
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,400
will occur to them, and a whole
set of verbs will occur them.

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,290
And at some point,
you're going to start

128
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,000
developing this language--

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,490
developing this language--

130
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,400
verbs, nouns, and adjectives.

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,860
 

132
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,710
Also part of the
language, metaphors

133
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,400
are very, very useful
as a tool for designers,

134
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,020
so that the player
can come in and have

135
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,420
at least some grounding
for what kind of a system

136
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,010
they're dealing with.

137
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,300
And even if it's not direct,
it can be an indirect metaphor.

138
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,220
Command and Conquer,
which is one of the games

139
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,700
I used to play a
lot, basically me

140
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,000
and my friend used to play
with our little model tanks

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,950
and my friend used to play
with our little model tanks

142
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,470
and make up rules and have
these whole little battles

143
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,700
with our little toy tanks.

144
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,070
And it was basically Command
and Conquer brought to life.

145
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,440
A game like Quake or Doom
or one of these first person

146
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,270
shooters, it's kind of like
kids running around playing

147
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,230
Cowboys and Indians.

148
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,730
It's the same basic
activity and you

149
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,710
know when you get
in there, oh yeah,

150
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,180
this feels just like that.

151
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,040
The Sims I used to
refer to as dollhouse.

152
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,750
Really, that's the
metaphor for The Sims.

153
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,550
When you see The Sims,
it's a little house

154
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,350
with little characters,
and it pretty much

155
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,620
is like an animated,
brought to life, dollhouse.

156
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,000
When I was building
SimCity, I really

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,940
When I was building
SimCity, I really

158
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,080
kind of felt like in some sense
it was a digital train set.

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,790
People own these model train
sets, recreate little towns,

160
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,000
and I had several train
sets when I was a kid.

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,830
And I wanted SimCity
to kind of have

162
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,680
that feel of crafting this
little world that came

163
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,260
to life, this little automata.

164
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,480
But I designed it, I
built it, it had dynamics

165
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,870
and it could live
or grow or die.

166
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,500
But for me, that
metaphor of the train set

167
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
was kind of like a guiding
principle for SimCity,

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
was kind of like a guiding
principle for SimCity,

169
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,870
and even when it came
to how we visualize it

170
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,010
and how the graphics look.

171
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,380
We tried to kind of make it
look like a little train set.

172
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,290
I reference a lot these kind
of childhood experiences,

173
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,090
whether it's Cowboys and Indians
or playing with model trains.

174
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,630
These aren't things that were
invented during my childhood.

175
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,120
These were actually
activities that

176
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,200
were probably around for
hundreds if not thousands

177
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,160
of years.

178
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,300
People were building small
recreations of real spaces

179
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
or playing games where they
ran around and played tag

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,660
or playing games where they
ran around and played tag

181
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,040
or whatever.

182
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,720
These are kind of
basic aspects of play.

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
A lot of these
dynamics and activities

184
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,770
and thought
processes that people

185
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,950
are doing in digital
entertainment, digital games,

186
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,440
are things that they've
done before in other formats

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,810
before they had computers
and all that stuff.

188
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,960
I'm certainly not advocating
that every idea that you

189
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,650
come up with has to
have some precedent

190
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,210
either in your childhood or in
history or gaming in general.

191
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,460
In fact, I'm sure there are
a lot of very cool, unique

192
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,000
experiences that are totally
unique to this medium

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,780
experiences that are totally
unique to this medium
