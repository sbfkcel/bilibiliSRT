00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,010
 

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,510
WILL WRIGHT: As we get further
down the development process,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,930
the prototyping we're
doing is far more granular.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,680
There are a lot of
things that you can do,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,870
and a very small
subset of that is what

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,910
you should do for the player.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,710
Scoping really is
going to come down

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,450
to what is the right sweet spot
for complexity and interest.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,000
And so you try to
find that sweet spot

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,030
And so you try to
find that sweet spot

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,220
with scoping and prototyping
as one of your tools

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,150
for discovering that.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,280
For "Spore," we did
50 or 60 prototypes

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,290
of different areas
of science that we

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,730
might have included in "Spore."

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,860
And again, most of
them were not included.

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,280
After playing with
the prototypes,

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,700
we decided either
it didn't really

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,020
fit in with the overall
concept, or that system

21
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,430
as a little toy, this wasn't
a very fun toy to play with.

22
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,100
But the ones that
were fun to play with,

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,850
we figured out, OK,
which one of these can

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,950
we now click together and
build into a larger experience.

25
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,440
And then eventually, they
turned into gameplay prototypes,

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,000
where actually there
is a game there.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,980
where actually there
is a game there.

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:09,800
 

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,900
One of the prototypes that
we developed for "Spore"

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,560
had a scripting language.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,890
And in fact, I could take
the same little code base--

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,470
I, as the designer, could go in
and change the scripting of it

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,110
and change the rules within
the simple prototype.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,350
And so I, in fact, was doing
a lot of the programming

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,500
on these prototypes to
explore different rule sets.

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,000
And in fact, I was able to
recreate very simple versions

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,970
And in fact, I was able to
recreate very simple versions

38
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,430
of "Sim City" and
a few other games

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,960
within these "Spore" prototypes.

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,420
And some of them were using
very interesting systems

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,620
and typologies.

42
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,180
Some were network-based, others
were grid [INAUDIBLE] based.

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,700
And the fact that as a
designer I could very quickly

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
go on and script--
over one evening,

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,180
I could try five or six
different rule sets,

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,150
play with them for a while,
gravitate toward an area.

47
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,490
Once they got roughly
in some area I liked,

48
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,450
I could take it back to
the programmer and say,

49
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,210
now build me a better
version of this.

50
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,670
Or maybe it had some limitation,
I wanted to add a little--

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,000
couple more commands to
the scripting language.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,230
couple more commands to
the scripting language.

53
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,450
But, in fact, I was doing
some of the programming

54
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,280
on the last half
of the prototype.

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,740
The programmer would give
me a little scripting engine

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,310
and code base that I could
script and change the rules on.

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,980
So again, it very rapidly
allowed me as a designer

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,330
to explore different rule sets.

59
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,730
 

60
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,310
A lot of times, I would
work with design teams.

61
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,300
And every week, there
would be a triage session,

62
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,000
and we would say, OK,
what are the biggest

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,050
and we would say, OK,
what are the biggest

64
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,940
risks of this project?

65
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,520
They could be
technological risks,

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,030
they could be design risks,
they could be production risks.

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,450
And then we step
back and say, OK,

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,970
how do we mitigate
that most effectively?

69
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,470
Sometimes a technological risk--
can we actually build this?

70
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,890
Let's build a prototype and see.

71
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,040
If it's a design risk, let's
see if we can find some--

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,750
build a prototype or
find some other game

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,590
that shows us this will be fun.

74
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,770
Can the production team
manage these assets

75
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,640
in time, whatever it is?

76
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,580
And hopefully, every
week we're trying

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,000
to basically attack the
top things on that list

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,930
to basically attack the
top things on that list

79
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,720
to where they get
lower on the list.

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,310
Now something else becomes
the top design risk.

81
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,880
So I think that as you're
going through iteration,

82
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,730
it's continually that process
of attacking the highest risk

83
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,610
items.

84
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,370
One of the typical
aspects of risk

85
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,370
in this kind of development is
that the longer you delay it,

86
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,320
the more expensive it is.

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,030
If I could mitigate
that risk this month,

88
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,320
it's going to cost me $10.

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,900
If I wait three
months to mitigate it,

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,530
it's going to cost
me $100, because

91
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,000
of all of these other things
that have to change around it.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,020
of all of these other things
that have to change around it.

93
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,830
So again, this is
about efficiency.

94
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,810
How efficiently can I
prune that design tree?

95
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,480
And I want every
pruning of every branch

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,140
to be as expedient and
as efficient as possible.

97
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,630
And a lot of times, you
really want to put it off.

98
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,010
You really want to say, oh,
I know it's going to work.

99
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,000
I know it's going to work.

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,380
But if you can
mitigate it early,

101
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,040
it gives you more
confidence later on

102
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,290
that you're on the right path.

103
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,000
 

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,450
 

105
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,810
There's so many times when
you're developing something

106
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,600
and it gets to some
point where it's really

107
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,790
starting to coalesce and
starting to feel pretty good,

108
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,920
but it feels that no
matter where you push it,

109
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,460
from that direction gets worse.

110
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,090
And this is you being
stuck in a local maxima.

111
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,000
And at that point, it can be
kind of apparent intellectually

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,700
to you that what you
really need to do is,

113
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,490
again, rip this thing
out, add that thing--

114
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,450
do some major change to it.

115
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,680
And you feel like
it's going to go here.

116
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,350
You're not sure, but
you're pretty sure.

117
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,000
But you know that you're
stuck here on this peak.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,810
But you know that you're
stuck here on this peak.

119
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,480
And that's a very hard thing
for you to kind of actually

120
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,530
take that hit and try
it, and maybe when

121
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,010
you do that, it's now worse.

122
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,010
But with a little bit of
iteration around there,

123
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,620
you find that, in fact,
you are on a taller slope.

124
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,020
But that's a very kind of
stressful kind of process

125
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,810
to go through, especially
with a team who's

126
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,330
invested a lot of time and
effort to get you here.

127
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,080
Now, really, you always do have
the opportunity to kind of fall

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,890
back if this is a total
failure over here--

129
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,430
come back to this thing and
try a different direction--

130
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,330
but that's incredibly expensive.

131
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,000
In my experience, all the very
best games, and all the games

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,830
In my experience, all the very
best games, and all the games

133
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,160
I've worked on that ended up as
hits were things where we went

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
through that several
times, where we really

135
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,360
had to kind of take this
hit and say, OK, look,

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,530
we're going to have to do
something pretty radically

137
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,290
different here, and I think
it'll get us on a taller slope.

138
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,160
In most cases it did.

139
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,330
A few cases it didn't, and
we had to kind of go back

140
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,160
to do it twice.

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
But it's almost like you're kind
of dropping little paratroopers

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
in to do recon.

143
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,250
Each one of these
is very expensive,

144
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,750
but if they land on a slope,
they can now tell you, oh, it's

145
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,680
a good slope or a bad slope.

146
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
But I think that's
really the difference

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,660
But I think that's
really the difference

148
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,420
between making a
really good kind

149
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,260
of mediocre game and a hit.

150
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,950
 

151
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,300
Tuning can be very,
very challenging,

152
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,980
and in fact, it's really
more a process of discovery.

153
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,010
And what I was doing for a lot
of things, like for "Sim City,"

154
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,810
I would actually
build test patterns.

155
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,480
I would say, I would expect
with this pattern of roads

156
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,060
or buildings, I would expect to
see this result on the traffic

157
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,860
layer in my head, then I
would actually draw these out.

158
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,000
This is kind of
what I would expect.

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
This is kind of
what I would expect.

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,710
And then I would run the model.

161
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,440
It would be nothing like that,
and it wasn't apparent to me

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
how I would change it
to make it like that.

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,090
But instead, what
I found was, I had

164
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,030
to make it easy to just
explore that space--

165
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,330
change the rules very
rapidly, very quickly

166
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,280
and look at the result, to
zero in on the right rule set.

167
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,800
And again, because it's
an immersion system,

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,980
there's no really predictive
way to know which way to go.

169
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,750
It's more like you had
to learn to explore

170
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,580
this space very, very rapidly.

171
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,000
And in more of just kind of
typical parametric tuning,

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,760
And in more of just kind of
typical parametric tuning,

173
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,470
Sid Meier had actually
a really good rule

174
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,450
of thumb, which is
that whenever you're

175
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,470
tuning your variable on a game,
don't move it by 10%, 20%.

176
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,870
Double it or half it initially.

177
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,060
And usually, it's
going to be way off.

178
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,250
So you double it or half
it, whichever direction

179
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,280
you need to go until
you're in the region,

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
then you can do the tuning.

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,320
But really, you're
probably way off to begin

182
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,790
with on almost everything.

183
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,820
And don't be afraid, even once
you have it running, to try it.

184
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,860
Just for the hell of it,
try doubling some value,

185
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,830
and see maybe--

186
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,290
the result might surprise you.

187
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,000
It might not be something
you were looking for,

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,580
It might not be something
you were looking for,

189
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,110
but it might be
something very cool

190
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,230
that you discover that way.

191
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:10,790
 

192
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,090
Most of the
prototypes that we've

193
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,350
created for the
games I worked on

194
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,890
were failures, which is good,
because, again, they're helping

195
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,030
us prune design branches.

196
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,900
Do we want to go that way?

197
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,290
No.

198
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,370
Do we want to go that way?

199
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,200
If you actually look, once I've
taken this branching decision

201
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,750
tree all the way down, most
of the branches can be pruned.

202
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,000
They're failures.

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,460
They're failures.

204
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,680
We don't want to go that way.

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,100
We did some really
cool prototypes

206
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,120
for "Spore" of the
galactic dynamics,

207
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
the balance between
interstellar matter and stars--

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,600
which I can spend quite a
while talking about it--

209
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,270
but it's a very cool dynamic
of the way stars are formed.

210
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,630
The gas cools, it coalesces,
gathers into molecular clouds

211
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,820
and starts more star
formation, which propagates

212
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,110
a wave around the galaxy.

213
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,910
Very, very cool dynamics.

214
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,310
But as we started scoping
the rest of the game,

215
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,440
we realized this
really just had no part

216
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
in the context of
the rest of the game,

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,330
in the context of
the rest of the game,

218
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,280
with the kind of point
of view the player had,

219
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,670
the tools, and all that.

220
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,030
So that was-- would've been
a very cool part of "Spore",

221
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,860
but, in fact, would've
been a very cool part

222
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,000
of a different
game, not "Spore."

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,250
And that's what we determined.

224
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,180
That's a cool game,
but it's not "Spore."

225
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,890
It's really hard
when you've invested

226
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,670
a lot of time and effort
into one of your just

227
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,820
passionate features
or components,

228
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,130
and either through
prototyping, testing,

229
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,690
whatever, it just doesn't have
a place in the original design.

230
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,000
Emotionally, I think you need to
kind of sit back as a designer

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,310
Emotionally, I think you need to
kind of sit back as a designer

232
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,460
and say, OK, am I
designing something that--

233
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,860
for myself aesthetically,
or something

234
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,850
that I really want to impact
a large number of people?

235
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,250
Other times, it'll
really surprise you.

236
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,650
The very first
game I did involved

237
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,410
flying this little helicopter
around this world and bombing

238
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,000
things.

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,710
One of the things I
built as part of that

240
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,900
was this thing where I
could scroll on and create

241
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,470
the world to bomb.

242
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,470
And that thing, which was
originally going to be

243
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,000
a throwaway-- this is the editor
I built for bombing the world--

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,870
a throwaway-- this is the editor
I built for bombing the world--

245
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,100
later, I was so into that--

246
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,470
I had so much fun playing with
that little world builder,

247
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,690
I took that and it
turned into "Sim City."

248
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,480
So what would have been a
throwaway prototype actually

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,340
evolved into my first big hit.

250
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,190
So sometimes if that thing
that you really personally care

251
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,330
about doesn't have a
place in your design,

252
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,450
that doesn't mean it doesn't
have a place somewhere

253
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,860
else in some other design.

254
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,920
It might be that's going to be
the thing that you eventually

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,460
turn into what it
should have been,

256
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,790
or maybe even you jump ship
and you go with that instead

257
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,320
and throw away
your original idea.

258
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, there's no hard
and fast rule for this.

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
I mean, there's no hard
and fast rule for this.

260
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,500
And again, that's a lot
times very hard emotionally

261
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,780
when you've invested that
much in a certain direction

262
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,320
to throw it away.

263
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
But that's something
that's, I think--

264
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,780
every field, you
need to kind of learn

265
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,870
when to fail and
recognize that failure,

266
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,370
and sometimes celebrate it.

267
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,640
Don't say, oh my gosh,
poor me, I failed.

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,810
It's more like, OK, I failed,
let's learn from this.

269
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,570
Let's make it a
monument to learning.

270
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,000
 

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
 

272
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,170
In your design, at
some point you're

273
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,210
going to have to finish it--

274
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,050
finish building it.

275
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,760
You have to scope your design.

276
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,780
It's important to not
overreach, but at the same time,

277
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,320
you don't want to
make it too simple.

278
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,100
You want to achieve
something kind of cool.

279
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,330
But it's really kind of a sweet
spot of diminishing returns

280
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,790
in some sense, but
also it's surprising

281
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,340
how the simplest
little things in a game

282
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,000
sometimes can be the biggest
features that people just love,

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,130
sometimes can be the biggest
features that people just love,

284
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,000
that you spent no time at all.

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,420
And a lot of times, you'll
spend all this time and effort

286
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,910
on some elaborate thing
that you think will be cool,

287
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,370
and it turns out
to just fall flat.

288
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,290
If you can discover that
prototyping early on,

289
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,480
that's the best way
to deal with it.

290
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,510
But overall in terms
of scope, I think

291
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,360
you want to put the
player into an experience

292
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,390
where they have an
understanding of the boundaries

293
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,220
to some degree.

294
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,640
And again, it's almost like you
can put a kid into any game,

295
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,000
and within a few minutes,
they can kind of intuit how

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
and within a few minutes,
they can kind of intuit how

297
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,410
open-ended that game is--

298
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,570
how much freedom and how much
agency they have in that game.

299
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,780
If you put a tiger in a
cage, the first thing he does

300
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,030
is walk around the perimeter
to define his space.

301
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,870
You know, how big is my world?

302
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,420
A lot of times, people
over-engineer things,

303
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,830
and programmers
tend to do that--

304
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,210
what if you decide
you want this later,

305
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,100
so I'm going to go
ahead and put it in now.

306
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,270
And they'll build something
twice as complex as what

307
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,570
you actually need for the game.

308
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,280
And this happens all
the time, especially

309
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,480
on the programming side.

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
The artists, I think, are a
little bit better about that.

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,640
The artists, I think, are a
little bit better about that.

312
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,010
Kind of understanding
hey, here's

313
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,630
the resolution we're
working at, here's

314
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,400
the way the animations behave.

315
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,320
And they're pretty good
at hitting their mark,

316
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,940
in terms of the sweet spot--

317
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,700
amount of time and effort
and budget spent on it.

318
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,190
I think the designer has to
have some understanding--

319
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,720
almost this psychology--

320
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,050
of the different components
of your game team--

321
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,470
this is the way
programmers think,

322
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,200
this is the way artists think,
this is the way the writers

323
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,670
and the sound people think--

324
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,220
and make sure that nobody--

325
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,000
no one side of that is
spending way too much relative

326
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,870
no one side of that is
spending way too much relative

327
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,950
to the others.

328
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,010
So I think a lot of it
really is a more balancing

329
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,540
act across the different
components of your game design.

330
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,330
So players are going
to come into your game

331
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,030
with this expectation as well.

332
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,900
They're going to see
it's an open-ended game.

333
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,510
I expect to be able to
do this many things,

334
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,070
I expect the world
to be this big.

335
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,480
Especially if somebody
says, oh, I like your idea,

336
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,680
I like your idea.

337
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,690
And then you ask them
describe it back to you

338
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,360
and see which parts of your idea
that they're actually repeating

339
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
back to you, and are
they adding things to it

340
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
or removing stuff from it.

341
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,000
 

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,420
 

343
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,260
As we're going through this
process of game design,

344
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,060
one thing that I found
incredibly useful--

345
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
and a lot of design teams
do this-- is basically

346
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,330
a form of triage.

347
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,180
The designers-- once they have
some handle around what this

348
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,020
game might be--

349
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,560
will come up with
a set of features--

350
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,370
it'd be cool if it had
this, that, and the other.

351
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,720
Designers will actually
put value judgments--

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,300
that would be really
cool, that's kind

353
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,040
of cool, that's so-so.

354
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
And so designers might
go in and give the A, B,

355
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,000
and C in terms of
this is what we

356
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,780
and C in terms of
this is what we

357
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,070
would like to have in the game.

358
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,530
Then you bring it
to the engineers,

359
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,220
and the engineers will assign
a cost to each of these things.

360
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,020
That's a seven.

361
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,680
That's a one.

362
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,430
That's a 10, that's really hard.

363
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,020
And so then you have to kind
of look at the two together.

364
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,060
You have to say, the
designers think that's an A,

365
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,730
but the engineers
say it's 10, hard.

366
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,310
This one, the designers
say it's an A,

367
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,660
but the engineers say it's two.

368
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,550
So that's a much better
return investment.

369
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,970
So basically, you're going for
the low-hanging fruit here.

370
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,720
And you use this to
reorder the list,

371
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,920
and say, OK, we're going
to go for the things

372
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,900
the designers want the
most and the engineers

373
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,050
say will cost the least.

374
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,000
And you read over the list.

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,180
And you read over the list.

376
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
Now imagine if we just
had those features.

377
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,840
Is that something viable?

378
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,650
Probably not.

379
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,680
So we keep going through this
over and over again, and--

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,890
But still, this might
really influence the order

381
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,310
in which we build
this, because we

382
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,910
can have something playable
much more early if we pick

383
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,870
the things that are a
little bit easier, faster

384
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,550
for the programmers
to produce, even

385
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,440
as just milestone prototypes.

386
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,670
 

387
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,840
There have been examples--

388
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,000
I mean situations where it was
so important to the designers,

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,250
I mean situations where it was
so important to the designers,

390
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,310
the cost was almost irrelevant.

391
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,960
It was really could
we do it or not

392
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,210
and can we afford that cost.

393
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,290
When we did "Spore," we
really wanted the players

394
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,780
design the creatures,
and we wanted

395
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,910
to have a wide variety
of possible creatures.

396
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,950
And we basically
couldn't figure out

397
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,570
how to animate these
things, because we

398
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,070
didn't know what they were yet.

399
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,840
Typically, animation
is very data driven--

400
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,540
the skeleton, that's moving,
has two feet, a head.

401
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,080
In this case, we
had no idea how many

402
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,920
legs does this creature
have, what's its shape,

403
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,000
where does the spine go.

404
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,650
where does the spine go.

405
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,810
So we kind of realized
early on that we

406
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,570
had to crack this nut
of procedural animation

407
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,250
to make it even viable.

408
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,400
And without that, we couldn't
go down that path at all.

409
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,180
And so we kind of
stopped everything--

410
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,250
got some very skilled
people, very smart people

411
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,100
working on this problem
for a few months.

412
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,160
And after a few months, they had
actually said, we can do this,

413
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,390
and they were actually
showing us examples--

414
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,510
prototypes they had built
where they were doing it.

415
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,020
And once we were convinced
that they could do it

416
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,000
and it wasn't an
expensive thing to do,

417
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,780
and it wasn't an
expensive thing to do,

418
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,910
we decided to go down
that design path.

419
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,040
So that was one where it was
basically imperative to have

420
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,980
that feature, and we just had
to find out if we could do it.

421
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,220
Other times, there were
things in a game where--

422
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,300
like in "Sim City," we wanted
to have boats and water traffic

423
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,520
in "Sim City 2000."

424
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,810
And because the way we were
doing the type of graphics,

425
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,100
we would have had to
go back and really

426
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,220
change a lot of the
graphics system to do that.

427
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,640
And the value was very low for
that version of "Sim City."

428
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,580
We eventually added
later versions.

429
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,000
That was one where the
design value of the feature

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,210
That was one where the
design value of the feature

431
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,930
was really pretty low and
the cost was really high.

432
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,800
And it depends also on
all the other features

433
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,610
you currently have.

434
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,440
You can't take any one
feature in isolation.

435
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,990
You have to say, OK, how does
that influence everything else?

436
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,980
Ideally, every time you
add something to a game,

437
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,300
it's like a force multiplier.

438
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,970
It's making the other
stuff even cooler,

439
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,790
making the world seem even
richer, or more emergent.

440
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,430
So it's important
that, as a designer,

441
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,100
you're always keeping in
mind the entire design,
