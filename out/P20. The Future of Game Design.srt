WILL WRIGHT: I
think recently we've

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,090
seen games evolve in an area
that was kind of unexpected,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,100
let's say, 15 years
ago when we had

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,450
the rise of the app market,
and tablets, and smartphones.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,010
We're seeing a lot
of what I would

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,820
call interstitial gaming now.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,730
These are very short,
consumable game

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,950
experiences on a
small screen that I

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,000
can do in a few minutes
on my smartphone.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,310
can do in a few minutes
on my smartphone.

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm seeing some of the most
creative games I've ever

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,200
seen appearing on tablets.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,810
It's actually a really
nice format for gaming,

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,160
wherever you want to be.

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,910
And it's, you know,
something that

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,450
doesn't have the stigma of I'm
carrying around a game machine

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,040
everywhere because they're using
tablets for everything now.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,010
So I think those
have allowed games

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,490
to reach a much wider audience.

22
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,700
And it's also allowed
diversification and exploration

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,000
of kind of indie games and
new experimental gameplay that

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,170
viable on the older platforms.

00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,910
Going into the future,
I think, you know,

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,370
we have VR starting to become
more and more accessible.

31
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,880
You know, I've played a lot of
the VR games, which I enjoy.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,770
And it's interesting.

33
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,450
As immersive as VR is though,
it's not the type of thing

34
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,870
where I'm going
to be up all night

35
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,000
like I was playing "Doom" in
a dark room for five hours.

like I was playing "Doom" in
a dark room for five hours.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,430
There seems to be for almost
everybody a limited time

38
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,580
that you can kind of be
in that box in that world

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,120
and, you know, without starting
to feel really uncomfortable.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,380
I think part of it is the fact
that you're totally blocked off

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,630
from the world around you.

42
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,170
And there's something,
you know, kind

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,740
of inherently
disconcerting about that.

44
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,280
And for that reason
and a few others,

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,410
I really think that there's
a much bigger potential,

46
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,510
you know, for gaming
in augmented reality.

47
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,450
Games now are-- I'm
consuming, you know,

48
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,000
without closing off
the world around me

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,070
without closing off
the world around me

50
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,990
and, in fact, are occurring
placed in the world around me.

51
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,120
They have maybe some
context even to where I am

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,590
and what I'm doing.

53
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,650
I think that the technology
there that I've seen

54
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,450
is still several years off.

55
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,760
But that stuff is
coming at us so rapidly.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,140
You know, I wouldn't
be surprised

57
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,270
if I was seeing some really
cool creative stuff in about

58
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,920
five years from now, you know,
as the headsets get lighter,

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,180
more transparent, less kind of
social stigma with the Google

60
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,630

64

Alongside of augmented reality,
I think that AI, in fact,

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,810
really is going to make
the biggest impact by far.

66
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,210
I think that--
and when I say AI,

67
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,880
I don't mean
intelligent opponents.

68
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,190
But I mean an
intelligent game system

69
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,190
that is understanding
the player, that

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,910
is watching what the player
is doing, and understanding

71
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,700
what motivates the
player, what they enjoy,

72
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,430
what they don't like, topics
they find interesting,

73
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,830
things that it can pull in,
other people they might want

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,000
to meet or interact
with on certain topics.

to meet or interact
with on certain topics.

76
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,280
I think that AI moderating
either as a game master

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,820
or even as a game designer
can fundamentally alter

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,920
the landscape of game design.

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,010
If you could imagine an
AI that could actually

80
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,020
craft a game uniquely
for you-- you know,

81
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
it might be that we all
start with the same kind

82
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,900
of generic game.

83
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,750
As we start playing, it
starts learning more about us.

84
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,460
There's a great book
by Neil Stephenson--

85
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,330
"Diamond Age."

86
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,670
And he describes this
magical book, which

87
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,000
is in fact a supercomputer that
understands this little girl,

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,030
is in fact a supercomputer that
understands this little girl,

89
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
understands the
world she lives in,

90
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,150
the context of her
day-to-day life

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,270
and starts teaching her
very effectively the things

92
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,740
that she needs to
know to survive.

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,180
She's like actually a
homeless girl on the streets.

94
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,550
But I can imagine
a gaming system

95
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,470
very much like that that
sits there and starts

96
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,030
customizing itself to you.

97
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,430
This is extreme
personalization-- basically,

98
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,380
if you had a master game
designer sitting over

99
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,460
your shoulder very quickly
and rapidly iterating,

100
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,600
reprogramming the game
around you to make

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,730
it more interesting to you.

102
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,000
If an AI could understand
you to that degree,

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
If an AI could understand
you to that degree,

104
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,540
it could also find other people
that are that similar to you

105
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,500
and put you in a
shared experience.

106
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,390
So it could be that
it finds, you know,

107
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,650
what other people have had their
game world evolve to fit them

108
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,690
in exactly the same way
that you've had your game

109
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,279
world evolve to fit you and,
you know, all of a sudden put

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,330
together in the same world.

111
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,260
There might also be
collaborative experiences based

112
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,000
upon this kind of an idea where
the AI is trying to moderate,

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,280
upon this kind of an idea where
the AI is trying to moderate,

114
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,460
you know, based upon
different people,

115
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,380
their shared vision or
which parts they share,

116
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,330
which parts they don't.

117
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,630
And, I mean, it might be this--

118
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,080
would be very interesting way to
kind of figure out which parts

119
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,910
of the vision we share,
which ones we don't.

120
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,650
And maybe the parts
we don't become ripe

121
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,000
for gameplay, you know.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,910
So there are a lot of different
things this could lead to.

123
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,510
But step one is, can we build
an AI that really is trying

124
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,250
to understand the
player at a deeply

125
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,580
fundamental level the same
way a game designer tries to?

126
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,750
In some sense, it scares me.

127
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,000
I mean, it almost sounds
dangerous that, you know,

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
I mean, it almost sounds
dangerous that, you know,

129
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,050
something like that could be so
addictive if it was effective.

130
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,940
I almost wonder if we
should somehow avoid it.

131
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,930
But I know we won't.

132
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,540
I know that if it's
possible, we will build it.

133
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,240
But I think that more
than anything else that

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,330
is going to be the most
interesting, disruptive,

135
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,420
fundamentally game changing
thing that's probably

136
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,630
going to happen in our field.

137
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,540
And I think that could happen
within 15 years or less.

The most fundamental aspect
of the future of game design

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,620
is it like almost
everything else--

it's becoming more and
more unpredictable.

the world to be
like in 50 years,

146
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,680
I think they would
have given you

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,550
a pretty reasonable
description of the world,

later if you went back

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,730
they would have been
quite a bit farther off,

153
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,080
but still in the ballpark.

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,500
You go to 2000 and ask, what's
the world be like in 2050,

155
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,820
I don't think we have
a clue or maybe we

156
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,950
had a little bit of a clue.

157
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,140
But, basically, the
future is increasingly

158

becoming less and
less predictable.

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,870
And this ties into this
kind of basic idea known

160
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,530
as the singularity.

161
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,910
In almost any dimension,
we measure humans.

162
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,620
You know, it could be
energy consumption.

163
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,810
It could be population.

164
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,980
It could be intelligence,
Whatever it is-- you know,

165
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,000
technology--

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
technology--

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,970
it's accelerating to
this asymptotic curve.

168
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,970
And so there are these
transformative technologies

169
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,900
approaching us.

170
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,460
And it might be biotechnology,
nanotechnology, AI.

171
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,120
Any one of these
things could radically

172
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,410
alter the world around us pretty
rapidly over a few decades.

173
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,440
And that's an indication
that our future is becoming

174
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,520
less and less predictable.

176
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,500
 

177
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Game design is one on these
fields where, you know,

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,630
Game design is one on these
fields where, you know,

179
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,050
you're basically committing
yourself to lifelong learning,

180
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,700
you know, because it's not
only so rapidly advancing,

181
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,950
but, also, you have such
a wide palette of things

182
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,860
you can do within that field.

183
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,740
I think that-- you know,
don't get too dogmatic

184
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,820
about any approach, any
platform, any philosophy.

185
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,940
It's really about being
adaptable, and flexible,

186
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,530
and open-minded, and
looking ahead, not too far,

187
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,720
but far enough ahead to
get some sense of, OK, I

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,000
think in three years we're going
to be going there or there.

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
think in three years we're going
to be going there or there.

190
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
And assume that you're
standing on shaky ground.

191
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,560
You're not standing-- we
used to live in this world

192
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
where every four or five
years predictably there would

193
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,430
be another platform coming
out on the console side.

194
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,940
And then we would know that
five years, we need another one.

195
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,620
And it was like very
predictable, almost

196
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,980
deterministic world that we
lived in as game designers.

197
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,020
That's not so anymore.

198
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,730
Now, you know,
five years from now

199
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,190
there could be some platform
we're not even aware of right

200
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,500
now that's the big fad.

201
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
Things are moving that fast.

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,180
Things are moving that fast.

203
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,980
So that's probably
the best advice
