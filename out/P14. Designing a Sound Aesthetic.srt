cohesive with what

then it comes together.

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,650
Is it fantastical?

165
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,570
So I think that there's
the style of the sound.

166
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,790
But there's also,
how overt is it?

167
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,930
Is this a very foreground sound?

168
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,680
Is it a background ambience?

169
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,240
Is it something that
sounds very consistent

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,610
through the whole world or is
it something that indicates

171
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,140
something special here?

172
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,860
That kind of thing, again, it's
very brittle in a way in that,

173
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,000
it's a little bit too
much, and it totally

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,730
it's a little bit too
much, and it totally

175
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,100
blows it; a little bit too
little, and you don't hear it.

176
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,170
And there's a very,
very narrow sweet spot

177
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,810
I think you have to achieve on
the sound design, especially

178
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,730
when you're putting
sounds against each other.

179
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,050
On the music side, that
is kind of a much more

180
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,610
subjective decision I think
on the designer's part.

181
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,190
But one of the things we
watned to do in "Spore," again,

182
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,350
was to make each one these
worlds seem unique and special.

183
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,880
And we couldn't
really have music

184
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,000
coming from these
little cities that

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
coming from these
little cities that

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,830
were supposed to be on different
planets playing the same tune.

187
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,700
So we took a stab at it.

188
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,380
And I'd say
reasonably successful,

189
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,750
we had a generative
music system.

190
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,740
We actually had Brian Eno
come in and help us design

191
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,530
the musical system in "Spore."

192
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,540
And he'd been actually
doing generative music

193
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,860
for many years.

194
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,410
And he worked with my
sound director Kent Jolly.

195
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,420
Kent was actually
coding up these systems

196
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,460
that Brian had been
doing manually.

197
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,290
And so in fact, in
"Spore," you can actually

198
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,000
open the little
city hall building

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,090
open the little
city hall building

200
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,190
and adjust the parameters
of the procedural music.

201
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,660
But every city in fact has
a different little melody

202
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,450
played because it's
all computer generated.

205
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,210
In "Spore," in fact, depending
on where the camera is--

206
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,080
how high it is
above the ground--

207
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,350
you get kind of different
layers of effects

208
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,480
that would come in and out.

209
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Way up high, you'd get more
environmental wind effects.

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,230
Way up high, you'd get more
environmental wind effects.

211
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,440
Like you're up in the clouds.

212
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,780
As you came in, you'd
start hearing things--

213
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,860
creatures, people, whatever--
moving on the ground, vehicles.

214
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,410
If you came all the way
down to ground level,

215
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,880
there was another
kind of ambience

216
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:50,810
of almost like gravel blowing
across the train or wind going

217
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,640
through leaves,
that kind of thing.

218
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,470
But it's actually a
fairly technical system.

219
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,110
And I think more and more
of the sound design in games

220
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,000
is getting to that
level of sophistication.

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,530
is getting to that
level of sophistication.

222
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,090
And so I would kind
of describe to Kent,

223
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,590
well, I think that
should sound more

224
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,680
like we're going into space.

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
What would it
sound like if I was

226
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,040
going from the
atmosphere with a camera

227
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,080
all the way out in space?

228
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,540
What would the sound
do at that point?

229
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,090
And we basically had to cut
out all the environmental sound

230
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,050
effects.

231
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,110
And we actually went
to music at that point.

232
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,780
And there was a whole different
soundtrack for the music

233
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,050
depending on what scale
you were at in space.

234
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,630
So we kind of figured
out, where does

235
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,000
the music inhabit different
parts of the game,

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,360
the music inhabit different
parts of the game,

237
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,039
and what is the
transition-- really,

238
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,480
the transition between
those is the trickier part.

239
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,650
Because especially if the
player is moving or moving

240
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,630
the camera between these, you
want a very smooth, seamless

241
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,960
sound design.

242
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,100
And that's why sound feels
kind of more brittle in a way.

243
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,290
It's pretty obvious that
when this object goes

244
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,820
behind that object,
it is occluded.

245
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,840
The visuals are pretty
obvious in terms

246
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,170
of where they should appear
and when they should appear.

247
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,880
The sound is a lot less obvious.

251
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,150
It seems like every
game, you kind of

252
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,350
expect it to have some
background song playing.

253
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,390
I think that when we
watch film and somebody

254
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,890
scores a film there,
there typically

255
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,750
is, even at a very,
very low ambient

256
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,360
level, a little bit of a
film score kind of running

257
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,410
through the whole thing.

258
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,810
So I think part of this
is maybe the expectation

259
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,570
we bring in from film.

260
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,000
I think that there's maybe this
thought that more is always

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,150
I think that there's maybe this
thought that more is always

262
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,430
better, so the more
music we have playing

263
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,560
and the longer it plays,
the better the game is--

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,770
which isn't necessarily true.

265
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,980
I think it's, in
fact, a delicate thing

it when you bring it

Sims," one of the things

269
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,390
I really wanted to
try-- and I did try.

270
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,740
And it was a failed try,
but it was fun to try.

271
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,680
And I wanted to
put laugh track in.

a few weeks--

to be this amazingly
secretive thing.

people that really

280
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,870
do most of the laugh tracks.

it was so abrupt.

Because people were
building in their head

these whole little
stories of these people

stories, it would

be like, oh, her grandmother

why we took it out forever

was the fact that we
realized that it was stepping

298

on the players'

found as a designer that's

that, a lot of times,

underused in some ways.

Some games are trying to
be comedies and all that.

had to pull things out

of drawers or whatever, which
is really hard to deal with.

reach behind their back

butt, whatever it was

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,280
about the Sims.

322
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,960
And the voice kind of
supported that a little bit--

323
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,790
the way they talked.

324
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,310
They sounded like little,
tiny strange people

325
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,230
speaking some weird
language that you've never

326
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,900
heard of before.

327
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,120
 

328
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,450
The unconscious metaphor we
were [INAUDIBLE] with-- this

329
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,920
is a dollhouse.

330
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,350
Then these wanted to be
like little, tiny people.

331
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,940
And they wanted to have
high-pitched little voices

332
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,980
and sound like little,
tiny people walking around

333
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,850
inside a little dollhouse.

334
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,630
Again, this is kind of a little
bit more subconscious, subtle.

335
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,000
But I think it kind
of supported the idea

336

But I think it kind
of supported the idea

337
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,600
that you're dealing
with a little toy

338
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
world in front of you
and little toy people

342
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,300
A friend of mine
designed this game

343
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,480
that we published called
"Sim Life" many years ago.

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,570
And it was an evolution game--
a fairly serious evolution game.

345
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,070
We're actually
tracking the genetics

346
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,150
of these little creatures.

347
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,340
And they could mutate
and evolve over time.

348
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,210
One thing we just threw
in at the last second

349
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,040
before we shipped the
game is that, whenever

350
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
two creatures came
and mated, at first,

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,390
two creatures came
and mated, at first,

352
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,120
they would just kind of do
this little mating animation

353
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,930
that was very PG.

354
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,910
He threw in the sound effect
that he made with his wife

355
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,420
I think.

356
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,600
But basically, it was
a little sound effect

357
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,330
that went like, ooh, la, la.

358
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,460
Just this silly little thing.

359

MICHAEL CORMIER:
And everybody who

361
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,460
played that game,
that was the one

362
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,660
thing they remember about it.

363
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,620
And every time they heard
that, they would just

364
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,550
laugh hysterically.

365
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,970
And for a lot of
players, that was

366
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,120
like 10% of the entertainment
value of that game

367
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,000
was that one little, tiny

five minutes to throw in there.

370
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,540

372
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,240
The whole game was so serious
that that one little bit

373
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,190
of humor really stood out to
people and surprised them.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

375

376
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,700
On a game like "The
Sims," we obviously wanted

377
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,410
to kind of hear the sims.

378
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,090
Initially, we
thought, do we want

379
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,710
to record people
saying real things?

380
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,000
No, that's going to
get way too repetitive.

381
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
No, that's going to
get way too repetitive.

382
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,630
It's going to
break the illusion.

383
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,050
Because really,
the idea was that,

384
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,910
if you were watching
people from a balcony

385
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,740
and you couldn't hear
what they were saying,

386
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,240
you could still kind of get a
sense of their emotional state

387
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,810
by the way they animate, they
gesture, their body language,

388
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,040
and the tone of
their voice-- not

389
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,530
what they were actually
saying, but the tone.

390
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,220
Are they excited
or are they sad?

391
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,540
Are they quiet, loud?

392
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,950
So we basically wanted
to go in and record

393
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,510

but was not understandable.

I initially brought in a few
voice actors using languages

396
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,300
that we just were not
very familiar with.

397
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,850
We first tried Estonian, because
Estonian sounds very strange.

398
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,850
It doesn't sound Slavic.

399
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,740
It doesn't sound European.

400
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,370
But we couldn't find enough
Estonian voice actors.

401
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,090
Then we found actually
a few voice actors

402
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,270
that actually spoke Navajo.

403
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,620
But that sounded actually a
little to American Indian.

404
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,410
Eventually, we found
these two voice actors

405
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,640
that were also improv comedians
that knew each other--

406
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,500
a man and a woman.

407
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,000
And we tried to describe
to them what we wanted.

And we tried to describe
to them what we wanted.

409
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,100
And they just started kind
of speaking in this gibberish

410
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,230
to each other.

411

And we listened to
them do it for a while.

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,710
And we started actually
giving them a little bit

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,830
of sound direction.

414

I was on the soundstage with the
other designer, Claire Curtin.

415
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,050
And we were kind of saying,
OK, can you do a bit faster,

416
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,520
can you make it a little
bit more cartoonish.

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,350
And we were kind of giving
him a little bit of direction.
