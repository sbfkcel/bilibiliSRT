interaction that you can

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,980
And it really kind of comes down
to an affordance or an action

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,900
that the player is
allowed in a game

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,270
and how the game
response to that action,

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,470
and it kind of defines
what the challenge is.

what is the puzzle, or what

are the items needed
to unlock that door?

If it's a resource

How are they being earned?

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,780
Each one of these is kind of
what we call a game mechanic.

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,200
They're like little closed
system of somehow interaction,

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,980
balance, economy that
you can connect together

00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,680
to make a larger
interactive experience.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,090
Mechanic is some kind
of process going on

34
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,730
between the player and the game
that you might attach metrics

35
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,230
to you.

36
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,000

Might attach a leaderboard
or scoring system to that.

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,430
But once you have that,
that process going on,

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,990
you can now use
that process either

40
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,630
to moderate the
player's progress.

41
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,820
You can use that process to,
you know, add difficulty.

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,780
You can use that process
to make the world more

43
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,450
interesting, more mysterious,
more kind of tangible.

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,820
You know, there
are a lot of ways

45
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,920
to use these kind of
what I'd call, like,

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,100
micro processes to build up
that larger process of here's

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,410
what it feels like
to be in that world.

48
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,000
In some sense, I think,
of this as the dynamics.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,320
In some sense, I think,
of this as the dynamics.

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,360
You know, as a player's
doing things in the game,

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,330
how is that game
responding to the player?

52
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,500
You know, what is the
conversation that the player's

53
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,410
having with the game system?

54
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,510
And each one of these mechanics
is kind of one type of phrase,

or interaction,
or you know, word

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,580
the player can kind of
express within that system

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,430
against the game, and the game
will respond in certain ways,

58
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,870
and the player's
kind of learning

59
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,630
to kind of converse
with the game system

60
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,950

When we talk about
game mechanics,

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,260
you know, again, to
me these are parts.

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,270
OK, and you know, it
can be a part that's

66
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,110
been used many,
many times, or it

67
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,570
can be a brand new
part that you've

68
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,880
invented all on your own.

69
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,970
And to me, you know,
what really matters

70
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,830
is the whole that's
built out of these parts.

71
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,930
You know, so I might
have, let's say, you know,

72
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,000
a fuel injection unit, and an
engine, and a differential,

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,250
a fuel injection unit, and an
engine, and a differential,

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,650
and wheels, and I start
putting these together

75
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,360
to make some kind of a car.

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,790
And maybe I decide I want
a flux converter, you know,

77
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,460
and I'm going to
invent a flux converter

78
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,700
and stick it in there.

79
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,430
That's great, you know,
but what really matters

80
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,740
is the entire car, you know.

81
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,680
How is that car going
to drive or not?

You know, with the
existing mechanics

83
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,520
that we have right
now, obviously we

84
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,690
can build, you know, a huge
number of different kind

85
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,240
of interactive experiences, but
every now and then, you know,

86
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,000
you might want that
flux converter.

87

you might want that
flux converter.

You might want some
brand new thing.

89

I don't think it's that
you just kind of come up

90
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,490
with a cool mechanic and
say, how do I use it?

91

an interactive experience

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,430
that I want to create.

93
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,230
Now, what do I
need to create it?

94
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,820
And if it turns
out that, you know,

95
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,270
there's something
brand new, you know,

96
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,770
there's basically something you
need in this that you cannot

97
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,260
figure out an existing mechanic
that will provide that,

98
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,970
that's when you go
off and make your own.

99
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,940
I am very happy to go off
and make my own mechanics

think about it

this is a new mechanic or not.

right mechanic, you know?

by me or somebody else,

there's always kind of,

in that gap in your design.

If we talk about
rules for a game,

110
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,410
I think that they are almost,
like, two kinds of rules.

111
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,450
You know, there are
the really overt rules

112
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,000
that you want to inform
the player about.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,560
that you want to inform
the player about.

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,270
You know, you need to escape
the dungeon, or you know,

115
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,020
this is a torch, you
know, whatever it is,

116
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,490
you know, certain things you're
very clear with the player

117
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,940
about.

118
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,210
Right off the bat,
you're going to say, OK,

119
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,540
to control your character,
you use the [INAUDIBLE] keys,

120

or this, or that.

121

So again, some something
you're very overt about.

122
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,470
And other things that
they discover-- you know,

123
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,800
a trend that started
10, 15 years ago

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,140
is that part of the
gameplay, the early gameplay,

125
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,930
is the tutorial, and
you encounter objects,

126
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,120
you know, as part of directed
gameplay early on, and the game

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,660
itself is kind of teaching you
how to use a sword in "Zelda,"

128
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,000
how to do this, how to do
that, how to cast a spell.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,110
how to do this, how to do
that, how to cast a spell.

130
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,850
But then there are
a lot of other ones

131
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,600
that you want to hide
from the player that

132
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,610
are under the hood,
that become mysterious.

133
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,530
And in a lot of ways,
you want your game world

134
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,910
to be kind of a black
box at some level.

135
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,530
And this is actually, it kind of
gets to the idea of immersion,

136
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,720
that a lot of times somebody
will look at a system--

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,760
when people look at the
simulation in "Sim City,"

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,540
they start imagining, you
know, this ungodly collection

139
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,940
of mathematics and things
calculating this incredibly

140
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,000
complicated city.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,710
In fact, it's far,
far simpler than that.

142
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,000
You know, in fact, we found a
fairly nice emergent system,

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,220
You know, in fact, we found a
fairly nice emergent system,

144
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,050
so it was a fairly
simple set of rules

145
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,440
that kind of emerged into
the complexity of a city

146
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,030
simulation.

147
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,890
If players, you know,
saw under the hood,

148
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,470
in some sense it
would kind of destroy

149
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,280
a lot of the illusion
of complexity

150
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,500
there, the illusion of life.

151
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,060
It's very similar
to the same reason

152
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,000
why we didn't have
the Sims speak,

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,870
you know, in a known language
because as soon as they started

154
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,540
repeating the same
things over and over,

155
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,550
they would seem incredibly
simple and robotic.

156
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,260
But when you can't
quite understand them,

157
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,660

There was this thing that we
started calling "the simulator

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
There was this thing that we
started calling "the simulator

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,090
effect" after watching
the first, you know,

161
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,570
kind of batch of players
playing "Sim City" a lot,

162
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,200
and then some of our
later games that--

163
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,120
They would write letters to
us, Oh, I love this game,

164
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,020
and they would
describe stuff that

165
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,120
happened to them in
the game in letters

166
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,540
they were writing to us.

167
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,990
And they would describe, you
know, things like, you know,

168
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,920
the airplane crashed over here,
and it hit the power line,

169
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,710
and it caused a surge there, and
then this thing caught on fire.

170
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,050
And they would describe
all these causal linkages

171
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,720
that did not exist in the game.

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,330
You know, I knew
they did not exist,

173
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,790
but in the player's
head, they did.

174
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,000
You know, nothing about the game
dissuaded them from the fact,

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,780
You know, nothing about the game
dissuaded them from the fact,

176
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,060
and so they were building
up their own models

177
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,860
of the way this
simulator was working,

178
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,170
you know, that were very
elaborate and interesting.

179
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,590
And that's when I
kind of realized

180
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,710
that there's certain parts
of a simulator like that

181
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,460
that you want to
keep a black box.

182
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,050
You know, the players,
you know, can actually

183
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,370
imagine their own simulation
usually far more interesting

184
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,710
than yours, you know, as
long as you present them

185
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,480
with enough scaffolding to
build that in their imagination.

186
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,980
And so we ended up calling that
"the simulator effect," that

187
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,000
when players are
imagining that your,

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,690
when players are
imagining that your,

189
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,410
your world or your simulation is
more detailed, more rich, more

190
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,350
complicated than it actually
is, don't talk them out of it.

191
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,160
And so, you know, part
of exploring the world

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,100
is, in fact, kind of uncovering
these loops of complexity

193
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,490
in these rules, and so part of
learning the rules of the game

194
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,160
are actually embedded
in the game, which

195
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,210
is actually very natural

196

There's this thing
called the Monte Carlo

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,440
method, which is
using chance basically

200
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,820
in the place of calculus.

201
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,920
You know, a lot of things
that would be simulated

202
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
in the natural
world, you know, we

203
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,110
have established mathematics,
which is linear calculus.

204
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,120
But it turns out that
for most of these things

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,700
with a computer, there's a whole
other approach that basically

206
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,100
can solve the same set of
problems, which is basically

207
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,290
throwing darts at a
dartboard, and you

208
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,590
have shapes on that dartboard
that are about, you know,

209
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,290
the right area.

210
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,660
I'm going to go
to the whiteboard

211
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,000
to kind of give you a simple
little illustration of this.

to kind of give you a simple
little illustration of this.

214
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,870
And just to keep
it very simple, you

215
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,540
know, let's assume
that we have some area

216
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,500
and that we have within
that area some regions.

217
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,080
You know, and maybe
this is the amount

218
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,130
of area developed, you know,
in "Sim City," or the areas

219
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,470
with police coverage,
whatever it is.

220
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,840
Now, normally if you
wanted to measure

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,470
what percentage of
this entire area

222
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,470
is occupied by these
blobs, you know,

there's some very

of going down the
calculus path that you

226
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,490
would use to measure
that and give you

227
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,600
a pretty accurate answer.

228
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
But if you have a
computer, you know,

229
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,690
and computers are
very fast and good

230
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,570
at just doing simple
things repetitively,

231
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,169
it turns out there's a
much simpler technique,

232
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,200
and they call this the
Monte Carlo method, which

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,900
is that we just sit here, and
we just randomly throw darts

234
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,410
at this board.

235
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,980
You know, and then we just count
over time how many of the darts

236
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,760
land inside of these areas,
and how many land outside.

237
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,290
And you know, you throw a
few hundred darts at there,

238
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,000
you know, and it turns
out that, you know,

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
you know, and it turns
out that, you know,

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,550
let's say out of 100 darts,
you know, 67 land outside

241
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,130
of these zones, and let's
say 33 land inside the zones.

242
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,300
That's the basic percentage.

243
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,090
You basically-- that's
33% of the area of that.

244
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,720
This is the kind of, you know,
simple mathematics, you know,

245
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,700
that we use a lot
in simulations.

246
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,980
And so this, in fact,
is relying very much

247
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,030
on these probabilities,
and it's the way

248
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,370
a lot of the emergence
that we get out of some

249
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,000
of these systems works as well.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,510
of these systems works as well.

251
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,970
So from the design
point of view,

252
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,000
it's amazing how you can build
super simple things like that

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,940
in place of what used to be very
kind of elaborate mathematics.

There's another kind of chance,
though, that I encounter

256
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,570
as a designer, which
is that a lot of times

257
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,780
I'll be making something,
doing prototypes, whatever,

258
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,660
and something just
pops up unexpectedly.

259
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,880
You know, either we made a,
put a bug in the program,

260
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,000
or it's not behaving
the way I thought,

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,860
or it's not behaving
the way I thought,

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,340
or something happens
that surprises me.

263
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,390
And through pure chance, I might
trip over some new mechanic,

264
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,230
or some new feature.

265
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,590
Or that reminds me of this;
let's try that, you know.

of accidentally discovering

268
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,870
something very cool, you
know, either in prototyping,

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,670
or testing, or
just even on paper

270
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,800
as I'm kind of thinking
through a design that

271
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,010
causes me to go off in a
totally different direction,

you know, tangent to where
I was going initially.

designer's point of view, you

how, kind of how you use
probability to your advantage.

probability to your advantage.

that they're random.

280
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,710
The players are always going to
be trying to assign causality

281
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,310
to something.

282
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,200
You know, if all of a
sudden that torch goes out,

283
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
or there's a sound over there,
the player in their head

284
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,870
is going to be
building some model of,

285
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,060
what caused that to happen?

286
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,050
Was it something I did?

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,550

foreshadowing of some event?

289
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,750
And I think that
you actually want

290
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,130
kind of a balance
there a little,

291
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,000

[INAUDIBLE] noise

[INAUDIBLE] noise

so that there's some stuff
happening in the world that,

294
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,820
again, remains kind of
a black box to them,

295
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,610
whether, you know, from
their point of view

296
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,830
it's random chance, or it's
some elaborate, deep, you know,

behavior of your, you know,
your world the player is going

to assume it's some deep
behavior of your world,

299
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,450
I think, in most cases.

But if it's something that
the player did, and you

301
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,720

the player did this,

302

and the door
unlocked, that's when

303
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,370
you have to make sure you're
getting above that, that noise

304
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,330
level, and it's totally
signaled to the player.

And so you need to make sure
that the feedback you're

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
you know, I don't
think it really

312
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,860
changes the nature
of wanting to present

313
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,440
an interesting, challenging
kind of creative world.

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,020
I don't think that--
you know, I think

315
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,520
that's kind of
almost, worldbuilding

316
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,000
is almost a different
kind of level to that.

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,250
is almost a different
kind of level to that.

318
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,510
The chance and probability--

319
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,890
for a player, you know, again,
it can depend on the game.

320
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,510
If, you know, you're
playing Casino games,

321
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,930
you know, you're
kind of expecting

322
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,630
these things to be based
around chance and probability.

323
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,960
If you're playing something
like a first-person shooter,

324
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,790
you're kind of imagining that,
you know, if I aim at that guy,

325
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,910
it's going to hit that guy.

326
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,560
You know, I don't want a
chance of having a dud bullet,

327
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,870
or my bullet, you know,
going off target just

328
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,050
through random chance.

329
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,320
So I want my actions
to be clearly,

330
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,000
you know, kind of almost
deterministic in that sense.

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,290
you know, kind of almost
deterministic in that sense.

332
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,790
So I think it depends
on the feature

333
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,710
of your world as to what
you're talking about.

334
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,780
If it's something like
"Sim City," and, you know,

335
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,470
when does a fire occur?

336
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,110
You know, that actually is a
little bit of a combination.

337
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,530
It's a combination
of, how much am

338
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,930
I done with my fire services?

339
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,060
But there's still a chance.

340
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,240
It's changing the probability
of a fire actually happening.

341
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,970
It could still happen even
if I have good fire coverage,

342
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,890
but the chance is lower.

343
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,560
And you know, for
the player, you know,

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,530
that's kind of the expectation
coming into a world like that,

345
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,030
and so really, I
think at that point

346
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,000
you're really kind
of falling back into,

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,170
you're really kind
of falling back into,

348
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,150
what feels like an
expectation of the player?

349
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,150
You don't want the world
to feel like, you know,

350
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,610
arbitrary things are happening
for absolutely no reason.

351
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,690
You know, so even when a
fire occurs in "Sim City"

352
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,460
when there's a low
probability, the player

353
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,580
can imagine that occurring.

354
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,040
You know, it's not an
unimaginable situation.

355
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,500
What you really
don't want to do is

356
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,660
you don't want the
game to feel capricious

357
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,040
in terms of killing the
player for no obvious reason.

358
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,730
You know, that, you know,
is really a major no-no.

359
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,420
The player always wants to feel
like their success or failure

360
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,810
is coming back to their agency.

361
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,910
You know, it's
their fault. They're

362
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,000
the ones responsible
for their own fate.

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,580
the ones responsible
for their own fate.

364
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:38,550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

365
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,430
Depending on the kind
of game you're doing,

366
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,100
you know, it does put the player
into a certain kind of mindset,

367
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,000
and they build a
certain kind of model,

368
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,180
whether it's like a first-person
kind of game with exploration

369
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,300
and combat, or it's a
third-person game with resource

370
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,110
management, you know,
they all, at some level,

371
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,990
share a set of features, share,
you know, certain amounts

372
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,000
of player agency.

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,060
of player agency.

374
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,530
They share world dynamics.

375
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,140
You know, so that's the level
at which these things are all

376
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,970
pretty common across there.

377
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,160
But you know, I
think there are so

378
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
many game mechanics that have
been used and so many more yet

379
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,330
to be discovered.

380
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,480
I think the designer
will develop an intuition

381
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,030
for which one of
these things they

382
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,790
want to put into
their palette of tools

383
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,120
and which ones they want to
become a master at because I

384
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,430
think that certain game
designers, you know,

385
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,900
get very specialized
and very good,

386
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,730
you know, within certain
kind of mechanics,

387
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,390
using certain parts
to build their games.

388
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,000
And over time, you know, you'll
start expanding that palette.

389
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,930
And over time, you know, you'll
start expanding that palette.

390
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,670
You'll start trying other ones.

391
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,470
You'll play other games, games
that you would not normally

392
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,420
play, and just to kind
of get a sense of what

393
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,500
those mechanics feel like.

394
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Is that a tool that
I could use, a part

395
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,680
that I can use next time
I build, you know, one

396
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,850
of my game engines?

397
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,550
I think for most designers,
you know, get familiar.

398
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,070
Get some mastery
and skill at, you

399
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,100
know, using a certain
kind of mechanics.

400
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,420
At the same time, always
be looking at new ones

401
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,090
and trying to imagine,
you know, could I
