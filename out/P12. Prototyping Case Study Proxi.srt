00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,820
WILL WRIGHT: Inside of each
of us, there's a subconscious.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,270
There's a whole region of who
you are that is, in some sense,

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,950
inaccessible to you, but
drives your behavior.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,000
The game I'm working
on now is called Proxi.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,150
And my core motivation
there is, can I

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,730
build a gameplay experience,
an entertainment experience,

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,000
where the computer is actively
trying to gain a deeper

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
where the computer is actively
trying to gain a deeper

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,330
understanding of the player?

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,880
Primarily through the
player's past experiences,

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,460
through their memories,
can I kind of interpret

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,250
the memories of your life, the
most important memories that

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,610
made you who you
are, and from that,

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,190
come to some understanding
of how you think?

17
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,980
What makes you behave
the way you behave.

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,020
Why you connect these
certain things in your mind

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,090
that most people don't connect.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,770
What drives your interests.

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,840
You know, how much
can I get a computer

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,000
to learn that
about you, and then

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
to learn that
about you, and then

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,970
try to build a representational
avatar of your id,

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,970
of your subconscious, that
you can now interact with.

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,460
And as it learns more
and more about you,

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,650
it kind of, in some
sense, comes to life

28
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,350
and can now interact
with other people's ids

29
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,910
kind of asynchronously.

30
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,280
It can go off in the world
and interact with your friends

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,250
or with, you know,
real or historic

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,810
or fictional
characters, you know?

33
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,230
How does your proxy get along
with Homer Simpson's proxy or,

34
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,810
you know, the pope's
proxy, or Mother Teresa.

35
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to know, can we
build a map of that?

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,420
I want to know, can we
build a map of that?

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,680
Can we start to understand it?

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,890
Can we build, you know,
a structural description

39
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,710
of how this thing works and
the connections it makes?

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,880
And what makes you different
from another person?

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,470
How is your id different
than that person's id?

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,220
How does it make you
behave in a situation

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,920
differently than they behave?

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,350
If we can start getting that
level of understanding--

45
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,380
And we're-- you know, I
think that analyzing memories

46
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,180
and life experience
is the path there.

47
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,340
And I'm not sure about this.

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,790
This is just kind of my--

49
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,690
my theory.

50
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,000
But that's kind of what we're
trying to do with Proxi.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,940

54
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,220
Today, we're going to walk
through the process of creating

55
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,500
a game prototype.

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,919
Basically, we're
always doing this

57
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,960
to answer some specific
question about the design

58
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,830
that we're working on.

59
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,670
I'm here with my
programmer Zecmo,

60
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,530
and we're working on
this project here.

61
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,260
And in this project, the
user is creating memories

62
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,540
that come into this
world and basically turn

63
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,150
into this kind of landscape.

64
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,480
And this is what we have so far.

65
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,000
We're trying to figure out
how should these memories come

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,710
into the world.

67
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,000
Right now when I
create a memory,

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,080
Right now when I
create a memory,

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,940
it just kind of pops randomly
into the world, right?

70
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,100
 Yeah.

71
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah.

72
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,010
WILL WRIGHT: Yeah,
it feels like it

73
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,300
should be more tangible,
though, like this world really

74
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,320
should have more rules and
more specific interactions.

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,050
So I want to prototype
something where

76
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,870
we try different ways to bring
new memories into the world

77
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,440
here.

78
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
I've been kind of thinking
about the idea of maybe

79
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,340
they come in on boats because
it's mostly ocean here.

80
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,580
 Yeah.

81
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,530
And they can wander
around and try

82
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,100
to find a good place
to land or something.

83
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,600
 Yeah.

84
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,160
So we could actually maybe
have, when I create a memory,

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,730
it actually is on a little
boat coming into the world.

86
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,060
And it sails around kind of
looking for a place to live,

87
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,560
you know?

88
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm seeing here, you know,
seeing this little boat,

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,690
I'm seeing here, you know,
seeing this little boat,

90
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,110
and I want to put it somewhere.

91
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,480
And as I'm looking
at this world,

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,260
I get the opportunity-- in fact,
I have to offload the memory.

93
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,910
And as I do, it will actually
kind of change the terrain.

94
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,690
It'll actually make continents
bigger, change the form.

95
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,930
And then the boat just
kind of disappears.

96
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,650
The boat's really just kind
of, like, the messenger.

97
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,170
But then it feels
more tangible, right?

98
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,420
 Yeah.

99
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,920
Yeah.

100
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,580
 So I think if we can kind
of prototype this, you know,

101
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,370
this little world with,
you know, landscapes,

102
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,750
but at the same time, have
new memories come in as boats

103
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,780
and let me kind of manipulate
the memories off the boats,

104
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,000
let's just see how that feels.

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,130
let's just see how that feels.

106

[MUSIC PLAYING]

107
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,590
 

108
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,840
So show me how this works.

109
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,340
 Yeah.

110
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,230
So the players just
created a new memory,

111
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,150
and they've come back.

112
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,710
And so we're going to simulate
this with a simple button

113
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,340
press.

114
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,660
WILL WRIGHT: All right.

115
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,360
ZECMO: And so here's a
new memory they just made.

116
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,030
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

117
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,030
And what do I do with it?

118
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,840
ZECMO: Yeah, so
it's running around.

119
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,170
Hopefully, you want to touch it.

120
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,470
WILL WRIGHT: Do I grab it?

121
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,110
OK.

122
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,870
Oh, I see.

123
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,030
So I pulled the memory off.

124
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,440
Oh, it made an island.

125
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,620
ZECMO: It made some
terrain, right?

126
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,860
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

127
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,190
So can I put more boats in here?

128
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,690
ZECMO: Yeah.

129
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,180
So they made a
couple new memories.

130
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,870
WILL WRIGHT: Oh, two boats.

131
00:03:59,870 --> 00:03:59,940
ZECMO: Yeah.

132
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,000
And then they made two, and then
they came back to this area.

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
And then they made two, and then
they came back to this area.

134
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,970
WILL WRIGHT: And
so basically, I'm

135
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,380
grabbing the memory
off the boat.

136
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,130
Oh, I see.

137
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,530
As I move it around, I get a
sense of the landscape, huh?

138
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,030
 It tries some
good feedback so you

139
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,020
know where the connections are.

140
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,810
 Oh, and I actually
get to see the terrain

141
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,640
before I release it.

142
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,280
 Yeah.

143
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,240
 OK, that's different.

144
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,760
That's kind of cool.

145
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,880
I like the tangibility of this.

146
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,930
These boats could have a
lot more elaborate rules

147
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,260
if we wanted to.

148
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,300
 Pathfinding, sure.

149
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,510
 There'll be the shipwrecks.

150
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,250
We could have collisions.

151
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,620
The boats, you know, maybe
have pathfinding and gravitate

152
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,000
towards certain
areas where it thinks

153
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,160
towards certain
areas where it thinks

154
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,370
it wants the memory to be.

155
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,390
ZECMO: I could totally have
that in another iteration, sure.

156
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,140
WILL WRIGHT: Yeah.

157
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,020
So this is adding a certain
level of tangibility

158
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,820
to our world and, you
know, kind of going

159
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,010
with that landscape metaphor
a little bit more heavily.

160
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm going to play with
this a bit longer,

161
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,110
but I think this is actually
a good direction for us

162
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,610
to go now.

163
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,700
I think maybe we're done
with this prototype.

164
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,530
I'd like to play with
it a little bit longer

165
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,640
and figure out, you
know, do we want

166
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,260
to elaborate on this prototype
or maybe go to another one.

167
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,040
But I think right now
this feels much-- oh, I

168
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
got a turtle this time.

169
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,630
ZECMO: Yeah, you
know, I had some time.

170
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,520
I finished a little
early, so I thought,

171
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,630
I'll throw in a little
fun thing like that.

172
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
WILL WRIGHT: Well
actually, I mean,

173
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,750
that's an interesting idea.

174
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,520
It could be that the memory
type is somehow related

175
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,770
to the vessel, you know?

176
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,850
Hadn't thought about that.

177
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,630
But just playing
with this prototype,

178
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,300
just because you threw
that in there, it

179
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,640
makes me think that, you
know, somehow the system could

180
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,560
actually look at the
memory type you're doing,

181
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,510
put it on a sailing
ship, on a motorboat,

182
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,940
on a turtle, whatever, so
it could have different kind

183
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,110
of classes of memory.

184
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,220
ZECMO: Yeah, I could
definitely add that.

185
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,420
If we want to iterate
on this one more time,

186
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,010
that would not be
hard to test out.

187
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,400
WILL WRIGHT: OK.

188
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,000
We might do one more
iteration on this prototype.

189
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
We might do one more
iteration on this prototype.

190
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,660
But I think this clearly
kind of answers--

191
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,550
this feels a lot better
than it was before.

192
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,060
ZECMO: Yeah, definitely.

193
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,560
 And it's a fairly
simple code fix,

194
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,370
right, I mean, to
actually realize this?

195
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,870
 Yeah.

196
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,450
I could do it.

197
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,000
In less than a day,
I could knock out

198
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,080
what you're talking about.

199
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,650
Sure.

200
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,080
WILL WRIGHT: So this case,
we've established basically

201
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,330
a resolution to this question
of how new memories come

202
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,560
into the world.

203
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,480
And just playing with
this for a few minutes,

204
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,690
I can clearly see that it
feels much better than what

205
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,740
we were doing before.

206
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,900
And not only that, but
based on just some things

207
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,760
that Zecmo threw in
there, it kind of

208
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,000
inspired me to think in a
different design direction

209
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
inspired me to think in a
different design direction

210
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,060
slightly.

211
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,390
So I'd say this, you know, was
a very worthwhile prototype

212
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,600
for the amount of time spent.

213
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,560
And again, it's not like
we spent a lot of time

214
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,120
on this prototype, but it
gives us much more clarity

215
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,710
on going down the design branch.

216
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

217
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,670
 

218
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,170
So I think that
prototypes like this

219
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,560
are really helping us explore
the space much faster and more

220
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,010
efficiently.

221
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,000
We're still basically in
an overhead world here.

222
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,510
We're still basically in
an overhead world here.

223
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,220
And I think one of
the other things we're

224
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,300
going to want to prototype
is different renderings

225
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,200
of the world, whether
we go to 3D, isometric,

226
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,150
with a full camera
rotation and all that.

227
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,110
It's going to be a real
balance there, I think,

228
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,060
between legibility of
the world and, you know,

229
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,350
the player being able to do
interesting exciting things

230
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,800
in there without having to worry
about the camera angle, right?

231
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,170
 Well if we're looking
at doing a 3D version,

232
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,990
I could take another day or two
to do a very simple version,

233
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,990
where it's just simple objects,
basic terrain generation

234
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,000
and just dragging things around,
and see how we like that.

235
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,540
and just dragging things around,
and see how we like that.

236
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,370
 If we could do it
without the user getting

237
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,500
too involved in the--

238
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,310
well, the camera
manipulation is the key.

239
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,340
 So perhaps just lock it to,
like, 90 degrees, 45 degrees.

240
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,220
It sort of frees them
from that constraint,

241
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,720
but it focuses on just where
you're placing it in the world.

242
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:13,960
 Right.

243
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,130
But also, this landscape, you
know, it's kind of a mnemonic.

244
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,280
So as I get a sense of that
landscape, all of a sudden,

245
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,950
you rotate it, it
looks different to me.

246
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,570
And, you know, the memory that
I put in the upper right corner

247
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,290
is now in the lower left corner.

248
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,990
And so that's why
I'm a little reticent

249
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,540
to go to full 3D, or at least
constrain the camera direction,

250
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,000
but we can still
kind of tilt it back.

251
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
but we can still
kind of tilt it back.

252
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,410
You know, get some pitch on it.

253
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:32,910
 OK.

254
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,670
So no rotation.

255
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,930
 Yeah.

256
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,990
 Just locked orientation.

257
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,280
I got you.

258
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,890
And just have that sort
of gradual pitch, that--

259
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,270
 Yeah.

260
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,400
And probably-- we're definitely
gonna want some amount of zoom

261
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
in, so the zoom might
be relative to the pitch

262
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,230
of the camera.

263
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,440
So maybe one of the things
we might want to prototype

264
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,260
is a world like this
where I can now, you know,

265
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,140
zoom in, have the camera
pitch change with the zoom,

266
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,200
pull back out, get
the overhead map.

267
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,740
Then I think we've gone a long
way toward establishing kind

268
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,260
of the user interaction
and the look

269
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,000
and feel that we now have to
kind of produce, you know,

270
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,550
and feel that we now have to
kind of produce, you know,

271
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,970
at a production level.

272
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,470
 Yeah.

273
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,660
I think the simple
restrictions would help maybe

274
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,410
produce it faster.

275
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,150
So that's the idea.

276
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,450
Yeah.

277
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:06,800
 Yeah.

278
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
And, you know,
again, we don't want

279
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,900
to spend more than a few
days, a week at the most, on,

280
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,020
you know, prototyping that.

281
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,520
 Yeah.

282
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,420
 And if we had that
plus this prototype,

283
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,800
now we're well on
our way to kind

284
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,140
of knowing what's happening
in that world, what

285
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,460
the affordances are, how
the user's, you know,

286
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,230
picking the camera angle
and all that stuff.

287
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,800
And yeah, I think it won't
take too many more prototypes

288
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,890
like this to get pretty
far down the design tree,

289
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,020
and we can actually start
committing real resources

290
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,000
to it.

291
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,400
to it.
