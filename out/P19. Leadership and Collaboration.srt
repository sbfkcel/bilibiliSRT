[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:10,210
 

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,640
 A design leader
on a team can take

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,810
a number of different roles.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,890
You know, they can start
the vision for a design.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,350
This is where I
think we should go.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,750
They can be the one initially
pitching the team members.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,370
You know, hey, doesn't
this sound cool?

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,980
Don't you want to come
build this with me?

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,440
At some point, you know, I
think if things are running kind

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,650
of nicely, you know,
that's when I start

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,770
feeling like a traffic cop.

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm like, you know, all
the ideas are pretty good.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,850
I'm like, you know, all
the ideas are pretty good.

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,710
And it's more just
a matter of saying,

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,200
you know, let's do that
one now and this one later.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,530
Let's give these two-- let's
build a prototype for that.

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,130
You know, it's more
a matter of that.

19
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,490
Sometimes you do have to
get dictatorial, you know,

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,490
and you have to just kind
of put your foot down.

21
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,860
A lot of times you'll get
stuck in this kind of standoff,

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,890
stalemate, and you just
have to make a decision.

23
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,390
And that's where
you just have to go

24
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,790
with your gut, your
intuition, and your instinct,

25
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,540
and say, OK, look, I'm just
going to resolve this now.

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,940
You try to avoid
that if you can.

27
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,830
But at the same
time, you're also--

28
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,000
you're not just leading
the design of your product.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,790
you're not just leading
the design of your product.

30
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,360
But you're leading the
process of your design team.

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,530
You know, you're telling
your design team, OK, look,

32
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,410
this is how I want us
to resolve disputes.

33
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,530
Or this is how I want us
to make creative decisions.

34
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,520
And so you basically establish
a process, or an etiquette,

35
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,670
some kind of rules of the
road for how these design

36
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,100
decisions can get made, how you
want them to work on your team,

37
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,600
and what you want the team's
basically philosophy to be

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,230
for design.

39
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,000
You know, I've
always wanted to have

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,730
You know, I've
always wanted to have

41
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,170
design spread out through
the entire team, if possible.

42
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,080
And so that's a philosophy that
you try to instill in the team.

43
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,840
So I think that's probably one
of the more important roles

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,340
the designer plays
that's kind of separate

45
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
from the actual product.

46
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,900
 

47
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,140
I've been talking about kind
of like the design team,

48
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,540
you know, almost like it's
separate from the rest

49
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,630
of the team, which it's not.

50
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,180
And, you know, on a lot of the
larger games I've worked on,

51
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,000
you know, we had several people
who were purely designers.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,630
you know, we had several people
who were purely designers.

53
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,920
But yet, everybody on the team
was contributing to the design.

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,500
You know, all the way down
at some level any idea could

55
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,449
bubble up from anywhere.

56
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,150
So really, ideally, you
want to start actually

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,750
distributing a lot of the design
tasks through the entire team.

58
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,700
Because somebody
working down here

59
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,850
on the sound system, or that
guy on the graphics system

60
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,710
might have some
really creative ideas.

61
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,670
And they probably know
a lot more about the way

62
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,280
that thing actually
works, and what

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,000
you could do with it than you,
as a designer, might know.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,310
you could do with it than you,
as a designer, might know.

65
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,560
As a designer you want to
have a rough idea of the way

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,670
all these things work.

67
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,720
But you're not going
to have necessarily

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,430
the specialized
knowledge of the way

69
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,800
that particular
cell shader works.

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,970
Or something like that.

71
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,810
Ideally, you want to find the
design talent within your team.

72
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,080
Learn to rely on it.

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,970
You know, basically make
it visible to other members

74
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,950
so it's not just that person
going around somebody's back.

75
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,020
But, you know, you really
respect that person's idea.

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,940
You want to go with it.

77
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,000
A lot of times people
will enter a game team

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,550
A lot of times people
will enter a game team

79
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,400
as a programmer, an
artist, or whatever,

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,320
but their real aspiration
is to be a designer.

81
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,340
You know, that's where
they really want to go.

82
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,470
And so if you could help
nurture that and help them

83
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,750
down that path,
you know, one day

84
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,000
you might end up with a
great designer alongside you,

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
or competing with you.

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,980
 

87
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,100
What I usually think when
I hear the word document,

88
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,810
I think of something
that you write down.

89
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,850
And then you print it out and
give everybody a copy of it.

90
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,000
You know, what I think is
typically much more useful

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,270
You know, what I think is
typically much more useful

92
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,730
in game development is
something like a Wiki,

93
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,070
you know, where it's
changing all the time

94
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,820
to show the current thinking.

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Because I think, you know,
even a game design is

96
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
going to be changing, you know,
if not daily, at least weekly.

97
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,530
Aspects of your game design are
always going to be changing.

98
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,930
And you don't want to
have everyone on your team

99
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,640
have to come back to you and
say, what's the plan this week?

100
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,760
But as you're making these
incremental or iterative

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,040
changes, you're
updating it on the Wiki,

102
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,220
you know, pretty consistently,
everybody can always

103
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,510
go back there and find out,
OK, what's the current plan

104
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,000
for our animation system?

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,130
for our animation system?

106
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,360
Or this or that?

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,970
And we found that to
be pretty effective.

108
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,540
You know, just in terms of
time management and all that.

109
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,640
One thing I noticed, you know,
when I started doing games,

110
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,930
I was doing almost everything.

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,170
I was writing the manual, doing
the art, sound, and all that.

112
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,180
Then I started working
in small teams, you know,

113
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,339
four or five people.

114
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,899
Eventually it was
like 10, 20 people.

115
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,390
When I was-- the team was
around 10 or 20 people,

116
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,640
I found that we would spend
about three hours actually

117
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,380
doing work for every hour we
spent in meetings together.

118
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,000
As I started working on
larger and larger teams, up

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,050
As I started working on
larger and larger teams, up

120
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,770
toward 80 people, 90,
100, it was the inverse.

121
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,530
We were spending actually three
hours in meetings for every one

122
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,080
hour we spent at our
desk working, you know.

123
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,710
And that is, you know,
obviously top heavy.

124
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,670
And, you know, you're
wasting way too much time

125
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,860
on communication there.

126
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,320
But now we have
more and more tools

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,340
coming online that allow us to
collaborate more effectively

128
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,300
with a lot less effort.

129
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,870
We don't all have
to sit in a room

130
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,910
at the same time for an
hour, having a meeting

131
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,540
about something all the time.

132
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,000
You know, we can
actually eliminate

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, we can
actually eliminate

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,970
most of those meetings.

135
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,400
So these documents
really, I think

136
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,450
it's more a matter of
group memory, you know.

137
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,330
And that's what a Wiki, for
me, kind of is like, you know,

138
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,820
me and two other designers
decided we're going to do this.

139
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,920
We put it on the Wiki.

140
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,980
If, you know, somebody wants
to find out what we're doing,

141
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,550
they look at that.

142
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,290
Or if they have an issue with
that, then they look at it,

143
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,270
and they come to us
and say, hey, there's

144
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,980
a problem with what you decided.

145
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,390
Then we kind of revisit it.

146
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,560
But you kind of wait for
these things to happen.

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,290
And you basically
try to get everybody

148
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,000
on the team to respect
that mode of communication.

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,330
on the team to respect
that mode of communication.

150
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,900
 

151
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,500
Well, criticism actually
it depends a lot

152
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,630
kind of on your background.

153
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,690
You know, we find the
artists on our team

154
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,640
are very familiar with
the idea of criticism,

155
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,200
because they go through art
critiques in art school,

156
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,810
and stuff like that.

157
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,270
You know, they're very
comfortable with that idea.

158
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,020
Programmers are not.

159
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,140
Programmers hate other
people looking at their code

160
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,680
and criticizing it.

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,540
You know, designers tend to be
somewhere in between really.

162
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,000
But I'd much rather feel
like an idea was tested

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,980
But I'd much rather feel
like an idea was tested

164
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,910
against criticism
and survived it,

165
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,670
then feel like it sailed
through unchallenged.

166
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,180
And if somebody comes to me
with a criticism of my design,

167
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,720
you know, at first I will try
to, you know, just kind of say,

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,890
OK, well, I'm glad that
you're at least speaking up.

169
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,460
And I might disagree.

170
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,470
But, you know, in
the back of my head

171
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,970
it might just sit
there for a while.

172
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,930
Sit there for a while.

173
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,430
You know, everybody
is going to have

174
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,180
an initial kind of
defensive reaction,

175
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,370
I think, to criticism.

176
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,330
And if you can just kind
of take a deep breath,

177
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,000
get past that defensive
reaction, even to yourself,

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,510
get past that defensive
reaction, even to yourself,

179
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,830
and imagine, OK, well, what
if that is a good idea?

180
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,100
You know, let me just
try to blank my mind,

181
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,950
live in a different world
where that's a great idea,

182
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,630
and imagine it that way.

183
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,370
If somebody comes to me
with creative criticism,

184
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,860
you know, real
constructive criticism,

185
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,160
and I really eventually
do think it's a good idea,

186
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,430
or they sell me on it--

187
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,490
and that's a big process
and a big part of it,

188
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,080
is when somebody's
criticizing it,

189
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,780
can they present an alternative?

190
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,000
You know, it's not OK
to just say, that's bad.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,520
You know, it's not OK
to just say, that's bad.

192
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,630
I don't like that.

193
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,650
But if they say, I think this
would be better than that.

194
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,300
And they could really sell me
that this is better than that.

195
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,220
Or maybe even sell other
members of the team.

196
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,750
You know, so maybe
I don't agree.

197
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,560
But maybe the other
designers start

198
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,400
saying, hey, I think that
is maybe a better idea.

199
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,390
And I'm trying to sell
my idea against that.

200
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,390
You know, now it's in
a Darwinian process.

201
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,500
And I think that's, you know,
a place I would like it to be.

202
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,120
You know, you don't
want an idea that

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,550
is getting through
nepotism, or favoritism,

204
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,020
or, you know, Will said it.

205
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,000
So it has to be.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,090
So it has to be.

207
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,920
But if you feel like
your idea went out

208
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,700
there in the thunderdome,
and battled the other ideas,

209
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,260
and came out the victor, then
I think that's a nice way

210
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,890
to approach it.

211
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,930
As long as you just don't
end up with a bloodbath

212
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,220
of ideas fighting forever.

213
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,680
You know, at some
point you do have

214
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,660
to kind of make a decision,
move forward with some path.

215
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,300
But you want the whole team to
feel good about that path too.

216
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,710
You don't want it to feel
like, everybody on the team

217
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,020
thought we should do this,
but the designer said that.

218
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,000
 

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,640
 

220
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,940
In any type of
collaborative endeavor,

221
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,780
you want somebody who is not
going to be too dogmatic.

222
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,210
But at the same time,
is going to have

223
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,510
a very clear, strong voice
for what they believe.

224
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,680
And it's going to be pretty--
they need to be pretty

225
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,060
clear about what they believe.

226
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,310
You know, not just that they
say, everything is great,

227
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,360
or I love all that.

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,190
Or that if they really
don't like something,

229
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,230
they just get quiet
and don't say anything.

230
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,910
I would rather them--
even if I think

231
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,000
they're wrong I
would much rather

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,290
they're wrong I
would much rather

233
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,970
them speak up and clearly
say what they think.

234
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,640
That's the thing that
I think is missing

235
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,490
kind of the most on
the teams I've built

236
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,280
is enough constructive
criticism.

237
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,860
You don't want people
just saying, OK,

238
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,559
we'll do whatever you
say, and go do it.

239
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,810
You know, I would love to
have people push back on me,

240
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,300
and do things like that.

241
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,470
And not just on the design.

242
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,210
You know, also just on the
team dynamics, and everything.

243
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,200
My art director I worked with
for many years, just quickly,

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,840
he became what we called the
canary, in that, you know,

245
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
we would have these big
team meetings all the time.

246
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
And at some point the
meeting would just kind of

247
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,000
drag on and on.

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,440
drag on and on.

249
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,940
And there would
always be some point

250
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,620
in the meeting in which
Ocean would put up his hand.

251
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,290
Can I leave now?

252
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,410
Can I leave now?

253
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,030
And that basically we knew that
the meeting had hit diminishing

254
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,290
returns at that point.

255
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,450
Whenever Ocean left,
it was like the canary

256
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,800
died in the coal mine.

257
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,220
But actually, it turned out
to be a very valuable dynamic.

258
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,640
As soon as Ocean
left the meeting,

259
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,860
everybody, oh, Ocean left.

260
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,370
All right.

261
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,420
We're wasting our time here.

262
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,020
And we'd usually
stop the meeting.
