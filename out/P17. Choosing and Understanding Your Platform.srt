00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:10,300
 

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,930
 As I think about
platforms, you know,

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,480
maybe I think about them in a
different way than most people.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,910
But I think of the technology as
just one part of the platform.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,940
I think just as important
is the cultural platform.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,930
What kind of culture?

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,330
Is this being played
in China, in America?

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,850
Is it being played by
serious gamers in Germany?

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,000
And the third being the actual
demographic, the person.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
And the third being the actual
demographic, the person.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,640
Is this being played by
young girls, by older men,

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,530
by a whole family together?

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,360
Is it a very social experience?

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,280
So really they are almost
like three platforms

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,350
we're dealing with here.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,050
There's the
technological platform,

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,220
the cultural platform, and the
kind of demographic platform.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,310
Understanding all three
is totally important.

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,850
You know, I think
that we are getting

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,770
a lot of freedom on the
technological platform

22
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,390
that we did not have before.

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,080
If it's a really big
game, you can eventually

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,830
put it on any platform
you want to really.

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,000
You know, it's a matter
of where you start.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
You know, it's a matter
of where you start.

27
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,080
The other ones are really going
to be much more constrained

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,650
over time.

29
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,530
You know, if this game is really
targeting 12-year-old girls,

30
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,320
it doesn't matter whether
it's on an iPad or a PC.

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,670
That's kind of what the
game's DNA is about.

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,080
So I tend to think of all
three together as the platform.

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,100
 

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,750
The whole world has
changed so much,

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,680
you know, in terms of app
markets, mobile, tablets,

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,970
online.

37
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,000
And it looked, you know, with
console development and really

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
And it looked, you know, with
console development and really

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,580
big PC game
development, you know,

40
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,290
the teams were getting
larger and larger,

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,830
and the budgets in the tens
of millions of dollars.

42
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,330
And all of a sudden, you know,
it looked like, you know,

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,200
we were doomed.

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,740
You know, you had
to have $50 million

45
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,310
and a team of 100
people design a game.

46
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,770
Now it's totally reversed.

47
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,630
Now we're back to where a small
group of passionate people

48
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,020
can create a cool game
on an iPad or whatever,

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,420
and release it pretty
effectively on the app store.

50
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,790
Now it's a matter of, you
know, press, marketing, and how

51
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,000
you actually get people to
download it and try it out.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,580
you actually get people to
download it and try it out.

53
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,950
But at least you
have the ability

54
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,150
to create and have it
available to people.

55
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,770
And also to learn about it, you
know, very quickly, and iterate

56
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,460
on it.

57
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,520
So the dynamics have
changed dramatically.

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,620
And I like that idea just
as a design point of view

59
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,220
that now I have the
opportunity to learn much more

60
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,070
effectively and much
faster from our players,

61
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,050
and shift directions-- you
know, pivot very easily.

62
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,810
Whereas before pivots
were incredibly expensive.

63
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,750
So to me-- and, you
know, also the fact

64
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,630
that it's now kind of more
ubiquitous, in terms of I

65
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,000
might have my laptop, my iPad or
my phone with me in my pocket.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,210
might have my laptop, my iPad or
my phone with me in my pocket.

67
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,760
I can have parts of the game
that are very interstitial.

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,830
I could pull out of my
pocket my phone and play

69
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,560
for a minute or two, go
home, pick up my iPad,

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,490
do something else.

71
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,680
But still play it, you
know, on a browser on my PC

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,350
if I want to.

73
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,810
So the fact that the game is
becoming kind of more platform

74
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,190
independent is very attractive
to me as a designer.

75
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,930
 

76
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,000
I think nowadays
we actually have

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,300
I think nowadays
we actually have

78
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,430
a much wider range of
potential business models

79
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,170
than we used to.

80
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,920
You know, it used to
be that you basically

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,360
had to put this in a
box and sell it for $40.

82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,820
Unless it was
something that people

83
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,530
would pay $40 for, and go to the
store, and buy off the shelf,

84
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,310
you know, it wasn't
going to make sense.

85
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,020
Now we have a wide
range of ways.

86
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,340
Free to play.

87
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,290
Monetize incrementally.

88
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,160
You know, whatever it is.

89
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,520
But I think from the
design point of view,

90
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,780
you fundamentally have to create
a compelling, excellent, unique

91
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,000
experience.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,350
experience.

93
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,890
And if you really hit
that mark, now you

94
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,410
have all number of
opportunities for monetizing it.

95
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,250
You know, I don't really
think in terms of,

96
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,420
let's first decide how we're
going to monetize this.

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,580
And now let's design it.

98
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,370
I think in terms of,
let's design something

99
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,770
that's going to be just
so damn cool that people

100
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,850
are going to want it.

101
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,190
And now we have this whole
range of ways in which we

102
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,610
can choose to monetize it.

103
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,870
You know, and over time, as
we're developing the game,

104
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,900
and the world around us is
changing very rapidly as well,

105
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,690
and looking at the
platforms we're on,

106
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,480
we can zero in on the
right monetary model.

107
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,000
Or we might even offer several
different monetary models.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,510
Or we might even offer several
different monetary models.

109
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,060
There doesn't have
to be just one.

110
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,810
We have this wide range
of economic models

111
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,030
now, and how to
monetize your game.

112
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,790
And a lot of that's going to be
relative to your player base.

113
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,340
You know, who are
expecting to buy this game

114
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,510
or play this game.

115
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,610
And these people,
depending on who they are,

116
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,209
are going to have certain
comfort zones and certain kind

117
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,230
of uncomfort zones.

118
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,860
And some people,
they were coming

119
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,900
from "World of Warcraft."

120
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,860
And they're used to,
you know, subscription.

121
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,690
Other people aren't.

122
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,540
You know, for them they
have to download it for free

123
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,080
and be able to play
it for five hours

124
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
before they will
spend a dime on it.

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,090
before they will
spend a dime on it.

126
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,890
That's going to
depend a lot on that.

127
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,810
So I think once you
start zeroing in

128
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,980
and you get a sense of who's
playing this game, what

129
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,470
their prior
experience is, and how

130
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,840
they are used to monetizing
their entertainment,

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,390
then you can figure out--

132
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,140
I think it's easier
to now adapt your game

133
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,270
design to that
monetary model than it

134
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,920
is to pick a monetary model,
and then force it on people

135
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,210
that are uncomfortable with it.

136
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,270
 

137
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,000
I tend to not want
to get too dependent

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
I tend to not want
to get too dependent

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,490
on specific affordances,
you know, through interface

140
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,100
or otherwise in a platform.

141
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,160
But if they're there,
happily use them.

142
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,910
And, again, the goal being that
the interface and my agency

143
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,230
through into this game
should be transparent.

144
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,080
So if anything actually
makes that agency

145
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840
feel more transparent and
disappear in my head, fine.

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,990
I'll use it.

147
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,950
Whether it's VR, or whether
it's accelerometer on my phone,

148
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,460
or a joystick on my desktop.

149
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,000
I'd say that I would not want
to build a game concept that's

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
I'd say that I would not want
to build a game concept that's

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
just built around the
accelerometer, for instance.

152
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,230
I mean, maybe parts of
the game can use that.

153
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,230
But not a critical part.

154
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,280
You know, if I happen
to have the phone.

155
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,560
But maybe I'm using
my iPad, and I

156
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,810
don't want to tilt the screen.

157
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,950
Whatever it might be.

158
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,120
So I would say that I would
use these things as kind

159
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,080
of like upside, or affordance--

160
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,990
what should I say?

161
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,810
Lower the friction of the
interaction with the player.

162
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,390
But not something that the game
features are totally dependent

163
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,440
upon.

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,390
But occasionally, you
know, I'll find things

165
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,680
like that that change the
way I feel about a game.

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,000
I've played a lot of
racing games on the PC.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,510
I've played a lot of
racing games on the PC.

168
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,630
And they're kind of
fun and all that.

169
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,840
And the first time I played
a racing game on my iPad,

170
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,500
I was actually holding
it, and then just

171
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,580
turning the whole iPad.

172
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,020
And it felt so much
more natural to me

173
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,450
than using a joystick
or the keyboard.

174
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,090
And I really enjoyed it.

175
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,920
I found that I actually
enjoyed racing games

176
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,250
on my iPad more, just cause
it felt so natural tilting it

177
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,940
back and forth.

178
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,500
So sometimes these
things will zero you

179
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,920
in on something that gets
you into a different dynamic

180
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,750
than you had before.

181
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,000
 

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,620
 

183
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,350
I always preferred
PC development,

184
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,310
just because it was, in some
ways, a lot more malleable.

185
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,440
It was easier to iterate,
easier to kind of try out

186
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,090
and go in different directions.

187
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,100
You know, the consoles were
in this very kind of lockstep

188
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,330
generation release cycles.

189
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,610
You know, every five years
would be the next Xbox

190
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,460
or the next Playstation.

191
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,840
The PC was something that
was kind of slowly ramping

192
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,220
the whole time.

193
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,000
And also the PC initially
was a much better platform

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,050
And also the PC initially
was a much better platform

195
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,210
for social sharing,
and things like that.

196
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,000
People on their PCs were
connected to the network

197
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,860
much more readily,
until the consoles were.

198
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,360
And even the
consoles, typically it

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,860
was like these
walled gardens, where

200
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,450
if you did it on this
platform, you couldn't really

201
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,610
cross into that platform.

202
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,570
And a lot of licensing
restrictions, and things

203
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,070
like that.

204
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,270
So the PC, just
to me, was always

205
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,860
kind of a more free, open
ended design platform.

206
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,340
To become a console
developer you

207
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,130
also needed to buy an
expensive console system,

208
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,540
and so many workstations.

209
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,000
And, you know, there was
a lot of expense to it.

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,060
And, you know, there was
a lot of expense to it.

211
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,300
And we started my first
company, Maxis, on a shoestring.

212
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,750
And, we can always just buy
PCs cheap, get programmers.

213
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,320
So economically it was
a much easier entry.

214
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,900
But also, you know,
in the early days

215
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,660
we were actually developing most
of our stuff on the Macintosh

216
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,470
first.

217
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,870
And we would convert
it to the PC later.

218
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,870
The Macintosh was just
kind of a joy to program.

219
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,750
It was a very clean system.

220
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,540
It didn't have all the
different, you know,

221
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,050
video card and
configuration issues.

222
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,970
But there turned out to
be something else that

223
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,310
was actually really
to our benefit, which

224
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,000
is that, in the early days,
most of the journalists

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,910
is that, in the early days,
most of the journalists

226
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,910
out there had Macs, not PCs.

227
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,030
And since our games were
released on the Mac first,

228
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,190
they were some of the very
first decent games on the Mac.

229
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,880
And so writers that were writing
for these different magazines,

230
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,380
you know, they would
tend to, you know,

231
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,880
see our games as
one of the few they

232
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,380
could actually kind of try.

233
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,870
And then if they liked it a
lot, they would write about it.

234
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,790
Because that's what they
wrote on was the Mac.

235
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,560
You know, so our
first big break was--

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,190
I think it was in
"Newsweek" magazine.

237
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,060
The first full page
review of a computer game

238
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,390
was in "Newsweek."

239
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,000
And it was because the writer
happened to have a Mac.

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,600
And it was because the writer
happened to have a Mac.

241
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
And our game was available on
the Mac, one of the few games.

242
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,340
And he loved it and
he wrote about it.

243
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,929
So the Mac was kind of, in
a sense, a hidden advantage
