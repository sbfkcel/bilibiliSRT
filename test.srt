00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,370
WILL WRIGHT: All of us are set
in our own little world view.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,770
We think we see the
big picture, but we all

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,720
see a little slice of the
world surrounding the lens.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
I would like to imagine that
people have the opportunity

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,900
to see a much wider set of
perspectives on the world,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,530
and that games might
be the mechanism,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,860
the vehicle brings that to them.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,650
 

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,690
We can take almost
anything and make it

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,000
a fascinating
interactive experience.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,610
a fascinating
interactive experience.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,700
 

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,540
What I'm really doing is,
I'm giving the player a toy,

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,380
and the player is
turning it into a game.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,080
 

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,500
Every designer has
the opportunity

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,980
to create something
incredibly unique.

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,950
At the same time, every
designer faces the risk

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,800
of creating something that no
one will be able to understand.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
As a designer, you're actually
dealing with two computers.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,310
As a designer, you're actually
dealing with two computers.

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,790
First, the electronic
one, sitting

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,519
on the table in front of you.

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,210
But more importantly,
the player's

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,400
imagination, the player's brain.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,670
And that one is
far more complex,

28
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,630
and we have barely
scratched the surface of it.

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:30,000
 

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,550
 

31
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,270
During the course
of this class, I'm

32
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,890
going to expose you to a number
of kind of fundamental concepts

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,510
about game design.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,860
Basically psychology
of the player,

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,220
the mental modeling
that goes on;

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,980
how to use game mechanics
as part of your tool set,

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,310
and how to develop your
tool set as a designer;

38
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,820
how to think about the overall
structure of what's going on

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,570
underneath the hood; how to
build emergence, surprise,

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,000
cool, detailed worlds; and
to try to predict what's

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
cool, detailed worlds; and
to try to predict what's

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,390
going to motivate
players of your games

43
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,139
and pull them in, and
get them emotionally

44
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,490
involved to the point where
they get into communities that

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,780
are built up around these.

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,240
And so there are many different
levels of game design,

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,490
and we're going to kind of
start with the fundamentals

48
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,050
and work our way outwards
towards larger and larger more

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,420
strategic levels of
thinking around it.

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,730
Every designer is
unique in some way,

51
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,000
and my games have
tended to be very

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,250
and my games have
tended to be very

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,240
specific in terms of real
world simulations generally--

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,280
games that tend to encourage
player creativity, player

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,430
storytelling.

56
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,550
There are a lot of other
approaches to game design.

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,980
But I think a lot of the
fundamentals that I'll

58
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,690
be talking about
in this class are

59
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,660
going to be things that can
apply to any genre of game.

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,510
And I think by going down
to that fundamental level,

61
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,030
it's going to give you
a lot more opportunities

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,610
to kind of come up with
creative inspiration

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,410
to bring in new
approaches, new ideas.

64
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,000
Basically, how to amplify your
own internal creativity in ways

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,180
Basically, how to amplify your
own internal creativity in ways

66
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,700
that are coming from a
fundamental level rather than

67
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,080
just the feature level.

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm Will Wright, and this is
a simulation-- a simulation--

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,060
a simulation--

70
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,350
of my MasterClass.

71
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:21,410
 

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,520
So you're probably
watching this because you

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,170
have an interest in games.

74
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,520
But what are games?

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,020
We all know what games are.

76
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,760
We play games.

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,000
More recently with
electronic devices,

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,310
More recently with
electronic devices,

79
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,450
games have taken a totally
different kind of turn

80
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,990
and gotten much more elaborate,
more ubiquitous in our lives,

81
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,770
I think.

82
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,890
But games really are something
that have been around

83
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,390
for thousands of years.

84
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,070
Different cultures
have played games--

85
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,900
board games, social games--

86
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,210
for a long, long time,
for a lot of reasons.

87
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,030
Games, really, right now
have different genres.

88
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,040
We have things like
puzzle games, first person

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,140
shooters, strategy games.

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,700
These are different
subsets of the game space.

91
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
But games really are a subset
of a larger thing called play.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,100
But games really are a subset
of a larger thing called play.

93
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,370
Play is just exploring.

94
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,190
Its experimenting.

95
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,810
It's trying different
things, usually

96
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,550
in some symbolic representation.

97
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,730
You know, some little toy of the
real world with a very low cost

98
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,460
for failure.

99
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,860
In a lot of ways, I think games
have been somewhat misaligned.

100
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,079
We've associated
games with violence.

101
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,040
You know, it's something
that little kids play.

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,290
But that's actually been
true of any kind of new media

103
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,120
that's come along.

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,700
In any kind of media--
you know, radio

105
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,000
was actually looking down on
film when film became popular.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,400
was actually looking down on
film when film became popular.

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,740
Film looked down on television.

108
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,470
Television looked down at games.

109
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,310
So it's really-- games are
the up and coming thing

110
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,200
that in some sense is breaking
boundaries, doing new things.

111
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,050
And that's what makes
games interesting to me,

112
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,210
is kind of a topic as a medium.

113
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,800
Games borrow from so many
other different design fields,

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,300
you know.

115
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,770
Not just entertainment,
you know,

116
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,840
storytelling, things
like that, but also

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,410
things like architecture,
product design, fine art,

118
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,260
mathematics,
cognitive psychology.

119
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,470
Games incorporate all these
different design fields

120
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,000
in an interesting way.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,230
in an interesting way.

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,780
And the more you
can expose yourself

123
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,490
to these different design
fields, the better a designer

124
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:05,990
you'll be.

125
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:13,420
 

126
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,070
I think game design is probably
one of the most challenging

127
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,690
design fields there is.

128
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,030
And I think to be a
good game designer,

129
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,210
you first and foremost
have to be a good designer.

130
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,080
And so I think just,
you know, getting

131
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,960
into the idea of the
mode of thinking of,

132
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
you know, how does a designer
think, how do they learn,

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,820
you know, how does a designer
think, how do they learn,

134
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,870
where they pull
inspiration from.

135
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,180
And don't close yourself
into just the gaming world,

136
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,760
you know, look at all
sorts of things all over.

137
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,640
I've learned so much from
weird fields like, you know,

138
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,070
Japanese gardening, or biology,
or economics, whatever,

139
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,610
you know.

140
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,200
You can pull all
these things in,

141
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,510
you know, and as a
designer, use these

142
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,670
as parts of your
creative palette.

143
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,100
One of the things that
I really would inspire--

144
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,790
try to inspire up and coming
game designers to do is, think

145
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,000
how do I learn continually?

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,430
how do I learn continually?

147
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,020
You know, from other
people, learn from myself,

148
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,160
my own mistakes.

149
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,850
But then also, just do it.

150
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,560
Try it, you know.

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
You can do something as
simple as design a little game

152
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,850
on a piece of paper and go
show your friend, let's play

153
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,100
this game, here are the rules.

154
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,060
See-- you know, see
how that works out.

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,830
And the more you're doing
that, just always inventing

156
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,330
little games, you
know, even if it's

157
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,970
with toothpicks on
a tabletop, you're

158
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,380
going to learn a lot that way.

159
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,690
And that's much
better than just,

160
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,520
you know, sitting in
your head for two years

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,230
coming up with your master
design, and then one day

162
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,000
trying to realize
it and finding out

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that it's too
complex to realize.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,190
that it's too
complex to realize.

165
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,890
You'll be much better off doing
continual, ubiquitous, everyday

166
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,230
kind of local game design.

167
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:45,870
 

168
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,290
Any designer, basically, when
they're designing something,

169
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,510
has to look at a
number of factors.

170
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,890
You know, basically
you're trying

171
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,880
to balance all these
things against each other.

172
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,950
So think about just a chair
and all of the different things

173
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,490
that you kind of
would like a chair--

174
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,000
you know, different properties
you would like from a chair.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,460
you know, different properties
you would like from a chair.

176
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,050
You want it to be, you know,
cheap, easy to move, easy

177
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,720
to produce, comfortable.

178
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,600
And these functions can
actually be kind of broken down

179
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,010
into a tree, you know.

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,000
So games have very
much the same property.

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,290
You know, there's certain
functional things about them.

182
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,090
There's certain things that are
economic about-- what does it

183
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,130
take to produce the game?

184
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,220
How much does it cost?

185
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,500
What kind of a team
do I have to build?

186
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,170
What kind of skills do I
have to have as a designer?

187
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,060
And the designer needs
to kind of understand

188
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,770
how to balance all
these different things

189
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,840
against each other,
because your final design

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,000
is going to be a balancing act.

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,130
is going to be a balancing act.

192
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,690
You're basically
balancing all these plates

193
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,730
on top of each other, and
it's the designer's job

194
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,000
to make them balance well.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,550
Now, as you're
exploring your design,

196
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,610
you're actually going through
this very large branching tree

197
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,580
of possible designs.

198
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,040
You know, there
are infinite number

199
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,530
of designs that you could
be building in your game,

200
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,790
and you can end up with
one very specific design.

201
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,160
And when you start
out, you might

202
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,140
have some sense about
where you're going

203
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,600
or kind of the area
you want to be,

204
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,970
but you do not know
exactly how to get there.

205
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,000
And you're basically exploring
this branching path of design

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,220
And you're basically exploring
this branching path of design

207
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,640
decisions, you know, starting
with very fundamental design

208
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,130
decisions.

209
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,350
You know, what kind
of a game am I making?

210
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,430
What's it about?

211
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,780
What are the controls?

212
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,590
Down to very incremental
design decisions.

213
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,140
You know, what color
is this button?

214
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,640
You know, how tall
is the character?

215
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,780
Very, very minor things.

216
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,610
And a lot of these
decisions are distributed

217
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,500
throughout your team.

218
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,000
And you need to make sure that
your team kind of understands

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,070
the vision so that
as they're balancing

220
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,260
their little parts of
that tree, that they

221
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,810
are in line with the creative
vision for the whole product.

222
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,310
Basically, as you're
exploring this tree,

223
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,810
there are a lot of
different methods

224
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,000
you have as a designer for
figuring out which direction

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,390
you have as a designer for
figuring out which direction

226
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,620
to go on what branch.

227
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,720
Now, you're really trying
to prune these branches

228
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,950
as efficiently as possible.

229
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,450
That's why when we
build a prototype

230
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,030
we want an answer
from that prototype.

231
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,789
We want to find out, you know,
do we go down path A or B?

232
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,299
If the prototype
can't answer that,

233
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,100
it's basically failed
as a prototype.

234
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,980
So we're really trying to
efficiently prune the branches

235
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,900
and continue down the right
path toward our final design.

236
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,230
You know, as I said, you don't
know exactly where you're

237
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,360
going to end up on this
tree, but the designer also

238
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,460
needs to kind of know
when you've gotten there.

239
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,960
A lot of times,
I've seen, you know,

240
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
game designs, or even other
designs where somebody went

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
game designs, or even other
designs where somebody went

242
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,910
a little bit too far, you know.

243
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,090
They, you know--

244
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,260
Some movies, you know, I
think had a perfect ending,

245
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,780
went a little bit too far.

246
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,360
And the designer
needs to kind of know

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,440
you've hit the sweet spot.

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,760
 

249
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,730
One of my design heroes
is Charles Eames.

250
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,400
Charles and Ray Eames were a
design team, husband and wife.

251
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,410
And he had a great
quote, which was simply

252
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,920
that "design is constraint."

253
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,000
You know, design really
is how do you, you know,

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,170
You know, design really
is how do you, you know,

255
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,130
work around constraint.

256
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,790
And without constraint,
there's no design,

257
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,400
you know, it's just
pure imagination.

258
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,900
So, you know, to
be a good designer,

259
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,250
you have to kind of
embrace that constraint

260
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,650
and say, okay, within this
constraint, what can I

261
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,010
do that's really cool?

262
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,680
And, you know, that
constraint is really

263
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,100
going to become your foundation.

264
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,800
It's going to be, okay,
here was my starting point,

265
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
and within that constraint
I was able to do this.

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,420
The constraint
could be, you know,

267
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,710
the technology in front of
you, how fast the processor,

268
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,830
the graphics.

269
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,320
But the constraint
can also be, you

270
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,610
know, what does my player know?

271
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,440
What kind of skills
do they have?

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,000
Where does their
imagination take them?

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,060
Where does their
imagination take them?

274
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,970
Those are constraints
just as well.

275
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,260
And the more you understand
your constraints, you know,

276
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,630
the more you can now kind of
use that as your starting point

277
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,000
to go off and do
something really

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,150
cool that nobody else has done
against those same constraints.

279
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:19,420
 

280
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,240
In a competitive game, you
know, usually with two players,

281
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,410
there's a concept
of a zero sum game,

282
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,980
which is that if a player
wins, he gets, you know,

283
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,270
a positive 1.

284
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,000
The losing player
gets a negative 1.

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
The losing player
gets a negative 1.

286
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,900
If it's a tie, they both get 0.

287
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,530
So basically, the sum of
the two players is always 0.

288
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,850
You know, either I won,
you lost, you know,

289
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,900
and it sums to 0, or it
was a tie, sums to 0.

290
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
That's a zero sum game.

291
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,420
So you can't have two
winners or two losers,

292
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,050
you know, out of
a two-player game.

293
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,070
A non-zero sum game, you can.

294
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,260
Both people can win.

295
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,450
The kind of games I do are
not zero sum games at all.

296
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,960
In fact, most of the
things I do don't even

297
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,540
really have a clear win state.

298
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,000
When you play something
like "Sim City"

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,170
When you play something
like "Sim City"

300
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,260
or "The Sims," what actually
I found very interesting

301
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,760
was to leave it to the player
to define the null state.

302
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,680
[GIBBERISH]

303
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,520
[SMOOCHING]

304
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,060
When a person sits down to play
"Sim City," I don't tell them

305
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,560
they have to build
the biggest city,

306
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,680
or have the happiest
people, or the least crime.

307
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,260
Players in their own
mind decide that.

308
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,820
You know, they think, okay, what
is, you know, my ideal city?

309
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,700
And they try to build that.

310
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,080
So the player is
actually the one

311
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,810
building the rule set
and the structure,

312
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,700
and the player is
the one scoring it.

313
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm really just kind of
giving them an open-ended toy.

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,450
I'm really just kind of
giving them an open-ended toy.

315
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,950
And then you get a lot of kind
of interesting different play

316
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,190
styles.

317
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,240
You know, certain players
trying to achieve things.

318
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Other players don't
even really try

319
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,830
to achieve anything
thing at all,

320
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,360
but try to use it for creative
storytelling or creativity.

321
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,900
A lot of people were
playing "Spore,"

322
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,490
not really trying to get
through all the levels,

323
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,160
but trying to just make really
cool things within the game

324
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,530
that they would then go out
and share with other players.

325
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,660
So for them, the win
state was more social--

326
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,120
kind of make something really
cool in this game, maybe even

327
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,460
just tell a story that
other people really like.

328
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,000
And to me, that's the win state.

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,080
And to me, that's the win state.

330
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,480
So, you know, I think
games have the opportunity

331
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,430
to go, you know, way beyond just
this kind of zero sum approach.

332
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:13,240
 

333
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,440
You can take almost any
technology that we have

334
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,840
and view it as an extension
of the human body.

335
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,330
For instance, you know,
television, telescope--

336
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,800
our eyes, our vision.

337
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,440
Telephone, you know, our speech.

338
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,870
Car really kind of
extends our legs.

339
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,000
If somebody hits
your car, you know,

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,210
If somebody hits
your car, you know,

341
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,450
you don't say that, you
know, my car was hit,

342
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,700
you say, somebody hit me
when I was driving, you know.

343
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,340
So me-- you know,
the car becomes me,

344
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,160
it becomes an
extension of your body.

345
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,560
I think that computers and
games and things that we're

346
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,700
dealing with on the
entertainment side

347
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,770
can extend a lot of
these in a lot of ways.

348
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,290
When I was watching players
play "The Sims" initially,

349
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,170
it was like, he was hungry, then
he did this, then he did that,

350
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,910
and they very
smoothly shifted to--

351
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,460
then I got tired and I went
to bed, and then I woke up.

352
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,710
So they kind of shifted
from he to I very smoothly.

353
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,890
We now, with these
little micro worlds,

354
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,000
have the ability to
basically externalize

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,420
have the ability to
basically externalize

356
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,790
what's in our imagination and
share it with other people.

357
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,540
You know, it used to
be that you had have,

358
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,390
you know, a very rich
skill set, like you

359
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,470
had to be a fine artist
to do that-- you know,

360
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,050
to paint something
in your imagination

361
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,550
and then share it
with other people.

362
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,130
But now with these tools, the
creative leverage they give us,

363
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,840
you know, average, casual
game players have the ability

364
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,630
to externalize, you
know, create things out

365
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,710
of their imagination, share
it with other players,

366
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,710
and actually have these
shared imaginary worlds.

367
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,340
In "Spore," we actually had all
these editors where the players

368
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,600
were making cool things.

369
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
In some of the levels, the
design of your creature

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
In some of the levels, the
design of your creature

371
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,620
really influenced,
you know, the way

372
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,140
you would play that creature
in the world-- its performance.

373
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,600
Other parts of it, you know,
like designing your spaceship,

374
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
didn't really have
a whole lot to do

375
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,790
with the performance
of the spaceship,

376
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,170
it was purely aesthetic.

377
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,950
But people would spend
just as much time

378
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,490
crafting this very unique thing
that was part of their player

379
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,080
identity in the game.

380
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,910
And as they were playing
in the space level,

381
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,580
they were, you know, front
and foreground all the time

382
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,600
with this spaceship.

383
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,410
And so they really felt, you
know, like that was them.

384
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,990
When you get to the
space phase, there

385
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,170
are actually millions of
planets you can go to.

386
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,000
And we could never create
millions of creatures,

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,420
And we could never create
millions of creatures,

388
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,850
so we decided that every time
a player made a creature,

389
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,930
it would go up to
our server and we

390
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,940
would use it to populate
everybody else's world.

391
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,560
And we were hoping
to get, you know,

392
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,200
maybe 100,000 of these
creatures, you know,

393
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,060
in the first months,
you know, after we'd

394
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,130
uploaded the creature editor.

395
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,010
Instead, it was so popular
that we got a million

396
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,430
in the first week.

397
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,990
In fact, we passed, I
think, five or six million

398
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,230
in the first month, which is
more than the number of species

399
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,980
on Earth.

400
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,710
So it was, you know,
kind of extraordinary

401
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,000
how much players embraced that.

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,010
how much players embraced that.

403
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,880
Basically, we were
turning the average player

404
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,780
into a Pixar artist.

405
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,240
They were able to
create, you know,

406
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
a brand new character
out of their imagination

407
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,810
and have it come to life.

408
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,940
And so I think that's one of the
examples of the computer giving

409
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,640
creative leverage--
a creative amplifier.

410
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,980
And a lot of people
are using computers

411
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,450
for different creative
fields, but same thing--
